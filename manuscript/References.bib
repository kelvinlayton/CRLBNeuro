  abstract = {In this paper, we examine the estimation of the parameters of a decaying
	complex exponential in noise. The strategy adopted consists of a
	computationally simple two stage scheme where an interpolation stage
	refines the coarse estimate obtained from an initial maximum bin
	search. The interpolators of Quinn, and of Aboutanios and Mulgrew,
	developed for undamped exponentials are extended to the damped case.
	In the process, we show that Quinn's estimator can be viewed as a
	linearized version of Bertocco's algorithm. Theoretical analysis
	demonstrates that the resulting estimators exhibit similar behavior
	to the undamped case, leading us to propose two alternative hybrid
	implementations that yield a significant improvement in the estimation
	performance. Unlike the undamped case, however, we show that there
	exists a finite number of samples for which the estimation performance
	is best, and which we determine in terms of the damping factor. This
	enables us to adjust the actual number of samples should it deviate
	significantly from the optimum. Extensive simulation results are
	presented to support the theoretical findings.},

  abstract = {An implicit exact algebraic solution of CPMG experiments is presented
	and applied to fit experiments. Approximate solutions are also employed
	to explore oscillations and effective decay rates of CPMG experiments.
	The simplest algebraic approximate solution has illustrated that
	measured intensities will oscillate in the conventional CPMG experiments
	and that using even echoes can suppress errors of measurements of
	R2 due to the imperfection of high-power pulses. To deal with low-power
	pulses with finite width, we adapt the effective field to calculate
	oscillations. An optimization model with the effective field approximation
	and dimensionless variables is proposed to quantify oscillations
	of measured intensities of CPMG experiments of different phases of
	the pulses. We show, as was known using other methods, that repeating
	one group of four pulses with different phases in CPMG experiments,
	which we call phase variation, but others call phase alternation
	or phase cycling, can significantly smooth the dependence of measured
	intensities on frequency offset in the range of 1 2 B 1 . In this
	paper, a second-order expression with respect to the ratio of frequency
	offset to -pulse amplitude is developed to describe the effective
	R2 of CPMG experiments when using a group phase variation scheme.
	Experiments demonstrate that (1) the exact calculation of CPMG experiments
	can remarkably eliminate systematic errors in measured R2s due to
	the effects of frequency offset, even in the absence of phase variation;
	(2) CPMG experiments with group phase variation can substantially
	remove oscillations and effects of the field inhomogeneity; (3) the
	second-order expression of the effective decay rate with phase variation
	is able to provide reliable estimates of R2 when offsets are roughly
	within 1 2 B 1 ; and, most significantly, (4) the more sophisticated
	optimization model using an exact solution of the discretized CPMG
	experiment extends, to B1, the range of offsets for which reliable
	estimates of R2 can be obtained when using the preferred phase variation
	scheme.},

	provide less and less useful information as the magnification factor
	increases. We also validate these results empirically and show that,

	to overly smooth results with very little high-frequency content
	(however, many low resolution input images are used). In the second
	part of this paper, we propose a super-resolution algorithm that

	Design Case-control study. Setting University-affiliated community-based
	hospital. Subjects Sixty patients with MS and 50 controls. Main Outcome
	Measures T2 intensities of the substantia nigra, red nucleus, thalamus,
	putamen, globus pallidus, and caudate; third ventricular width; total
	brain T1 (hypointense) and T2 (hyperintense) lesion volumes; Expanded
	Disability Status Scale (physical disability) score; and disease
	course. Results Deep gray matter T2 hypointensity was present in
	patients with MS in all structures (P<.005) except for the substantia
	nigra. T2 hypointensity was associated with third ventricle enlargement
	and higher T2 but not T1 plaque load. The regression model predicting
	third ventricle width included caudate T2 hypointensity (P = .006).
	The model predicting T2 lesion load included globus pallidus T2 hypointensity

	as a means of measuring the actual spatiotemporal magnetic field
	evolution during individual MR scans. Receive-only NMR probes as
	used thus far for this purpose impose significant practical limitations
	due to radiofrequency (RF) interference with the actual MR experiment.
	In this work these limitations are overcome with a transmit/receive
	(T/R) monitoring system based on RF-shielded NMR probes. The proposed
	system is largely autonomous and protected against RF contamination.
	As a consequence the field probes can be positioned freely and permit
	monitoring imaging procedures of arbitrary geometry and angulation.
	The T/R approach is also exploited to simplify probe manufacturing
	and remove constraints on material choices. Probe miniaturization
	permits monitoring imaging scans with nominal resolutions on the
	order of 400 m. The added capabilities of the new probes and system
	are demonstrated by first in vivo results, obtained with monitored
	gradient-echo and spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) scans. Magn

  abstract = {When surface radiofrequency coils are used for irradiation and detection,
	the pulse angles are greatest in the plane of the coil and decrease
	rapidly with depth of penetration into the sample and this intrinsic
	spatial variation in pulse angle makes it difficult to use multipulse
	NMR techniques. However, it is shown that spin-echo pulse sequences
	may still be used provided the refocusing pulses are cycled through
	all four phases as described by Bodenhausen et al. (J. Magn. Reson.
	27, 511 (1977)). This has the added advantage that signals are markedly
	reduced from sample regions where there is a large deviation from
	an ideal pulse angle. Thus the scheme also functions as a depth pulse
	sequence, and this property is preserved even when there are no delay
	periods. Additional depth discrimination is obtained by using additional
	phase-cycled pulses, e.g., the depth pulseAnalysis of the phase alternation
	introduced by Demco et al. (J. Magn. Reson. 16, 467 (1974)) for inversion-recovery
	T1 measurements shows that when this is combined with the above cycled
	pulses, additional depth discrimination is obtained and accurate
	t1 measurements may be made even when there are large divergences
	from the ideal pulse angles. Thus is a very good depth pulse may
	be used for inversion-recovery T1, measurements and-may be used for
	spin-echo sequences. Several simple spin-echo sequences are presented.
	These techniques help to relax the constraints on radio-frequency
	coil design imposed by the requirement to have good B1, homogeneity
	and therefore may have more general application, especially in cases
	where the need for a large filling factor is at a premium.},

	imaging, this work revisits the basic performance characteristics

	simulations and experiments on phantoms and human subjects at 2.9
	T, the study emphasizes single-shot applications and addresses the
	design of a suitable trajectory, the choice of a gridding algorithm,
	and the sensitivity to experimental inadequacies. As a general result,
	the combination of a spiral trajectory with regridding of the k-space
	data poses no principle obstacle for high-quality imaging. On the
	other hand, experimental difficulties such as gradient deviations,
	resonance offset contributions, and concomitant field effects cause
	more pronounced and even less acceptable image artifacts than usually
	obtained for EPI. Moreover, when ignoring parallel imaging strategies
	that are also applicable to EPI, improvements of image quality via
	reduced acquisition periods are only achievable by interleaved multishot
	spirals because partial Fourier sampling and rectangular fields of
	view (FOVs) cannot be exploited for non-Cartesian trajectories. Taken
	together, while spiral imaging may find Its niche applications, most
	high-speed imaging needs are more easily served by EPI.},

  abstract = {NMR relaxation data and those from many other physical measurements
	are sums of exponentially decaying components, combined with some
	unavoidable measurement noise. When decay data are inverted in order
	to give quasi-continuous distributions of relaxation times, some
	smoothing of the distributions is normally implemented to avoid excess
	variation. When the same distribution has a sharp peak and a much
	broader peak or a "tail," as for many porous media saturated with
	liquids, an inversion program using a fixed smoothing coefficient
	may broaden the sharp peak and/or break the wide peak or tail into
	several separate peaks, even if the coefficient is adaptively chosen
	in accord with the noise level of the data. We deal with this problem
	by using variable smoothing, determined by iterative feedback in
	such a way that the smoothing penalty is roughly constant. This uniform-penalty
	(UP) smoothing can give sharp lines, not broadened more than is consistent
	with the noise, and in the same distribution it can show a tail decades
	long without breaking it up into several peaks. The noise level must
	be known approximately, but it can be determined more than adequately
	by a preliminary inversion. The same iterative procedure is used
	to implement constraints such as non-negative (NN) or monotonic-from-peak
	(MT). The significance of an additional resolved peak may be tested
	by finding the cost of using MT to force a unimodal solution. A bimodal
	constraint can be applied. Decay data representing sharp lines in
	contact with broad features can require substantial computing time
	and some controls to stabilize the iterative sequence. However, UP
	can be made to function smoothly for a very wide variety of decay
	curves, which can be processed without adjustment of parameters,
	including the dimensionless smoothing parameters. Extensive testing
	has been done with artificial data. Examples are shown for artificial
	data, biological tissues, ceramic technology, and sandstones. Expressions

	Mean and raw values of T1 and T2 for each tissue are tabulated and/or
	plotted versus frequency and the fitting parameters A, B and the

	of water between the bound layer and a free water phase. Deficiencies

	distribution in the body cross section has become very popular among
	researchers in emission computed tomography (ECT) since it has been
	shown to provide very good images compared to those produced with
	the conventional filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm. The expectation
	maximization (EM) algorithm is an often-used iterative approach for
	maximizing the Poisson likelihood in ECT because of its attractive
	theoretical and practical properties. Its major disadvantage is that,
	due to its slow rate of convergence, a large amount of computation
	is often required to achieve an acceptable image. Here, the authors
	present a row-action maximum likelihood algorithm (RAMLA) as an alternative
	to the EM algorithm for maximizing the Poisson likelihood in ECT.
	The authors deduce the convergence properties of this algorithm and
	demonstrate by way of computer simulations that the early iterates
	of RAMLA increase the Poisson likelihood in ECT at an order of magnitude
	faster that the standard EM algorithm. Specifically, the authors
	show that, from the point of view of measuring total radionuclide
	uptake in simulated brain phantoms, iterations 1, 2, 3, and 4 of
	RAMLA perform at least as well as iterations 45, 60, 70, and 80,
	respectively, of EM. Moreover, the authors show that iterations 1,
	2, 3, and 4 of RAMLA achieve comparable likelihood values as iterations
	45, 60, 70, and 80, respectively, of EM. The authors also present
	a modified version of a recent fast ordered subsets EM (OS-EM) algorithm
	and show that RAMLA is a special case of this modified OS-EM. Furthermore,

	A technically feasible method uses a sinusoidal readout gradient

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the most versatile experimental
	methods in chemistry, physics and biology, providing insight into
	the structure and dynamics of matter at the molecular scale. Its
	imaging variant - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - is widely used
	to examine the anatomy, physiology and metabolism of the human body.
	NMR signal detection is traditionally based on Faraday induction
	in one or multiple radio-frequency resonators that are brought into
	close proximity with the sample. Alternative principles involving
	structured-material flux guides, superconducting quantum interference
	devices, atomic magnetometers, Hall probes or magnetoresistive elements
	have been explored. However, a common feature of all NMR implementations
	until now is that they rely on close coupling between the detector
	and the object under investigation. Here we show that NMR can also
	be excited and detected by long-range interaction, relying on travelling
	radio-frequency waves sent and received by an antenna. One benefit
	of this approach is more uniform coverage of samples that are larger
	than the wavelength of the NMR signal - an important current issue
	in MRI of humans at very high magnetic fields. By allowing a significant
	distance between the probe and the sample, travelling-wave interaction
	also introduces new possibilities in the design of NMR experiments
	and systems. 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

	We demonstrate that FR and SVD MRI are equivalent in the following

	part in many 'training' subjects, thought to be similar to the 'unknown'
	subject to be imaged. SVD MRI utilized a single prior image of one
	subject in order to perform dynamic imaging of that subject. We demonstrate

  abstract = {A model for water-macromolecular magnetization transfer is presented
	which addresses the mechanism of coupling between the hydrogen populations
	and the extraction of physically meaningful parameters from experimental
	magnetization transfer data. Both physical exchange between bulk-solvent
	and site-specific hydration-layer hydrogens and intermolecular magnetic
	dipolar coupling between these specific hydration-layer-solvent and
	macromolecular hydrogens are explicitly included, leading to a three-pool
	model for magnetization transfer. It is shown that the three-pool
	model is well approximated by a two-pool model for coupling between
	the bulk-solvent and macromolecular hydrogens when the dipolar-coupled
	solvent hydrogens are a small fraction of the total solvent, and
	the solvent-macromolecular coupling constant includes both dipolar
	magnetic, [kappa]dip, and physical exchange, [kappa]ex, coupling
	rates. The model is also extended to multiple solvent systems. The
	model results in a set of coupled equations that predict magnetization
	transfer spectra as a function of temperature and composition. Physically
	meaningful constraints on the coupling and relaxation parameters
	are established for systems in which magnetization transfer has been
	observed including solvated cross-linked proteins and lipid bilayers.
	Using parameter estimates based on these constraints, empirical magnetization
	transfer spectra are well predicted by the model. It is found that
	the degree of magnetization transfer becomes independent of [kappa]dip
	and [kappa]ex when these parameters become greater than about 50
	s-1. In the semi-rigid cross-linked protein systems where the mobility
	of the macromolecular matrix is insensitive to temperature, the magnitude
	of the observed magnetization transfer is consistent with being limited
	by the intermolecular dipolar coupling and spin-lattice relaxation
	in the bulk-solvent phase. },

	Superresolution consists in combining several images of the same
	scene to produce an image with better resolution and contrast. We
	propose a discrete data-continuous reconstruction framework to conduct
	SR performance analysis and derive a theoretical expression of the
	reconstruction mean squared error (MSE) as a compact, computationally
	tractable function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), scene model, sensor
	transfer function, number of frames, interframe translation motion,
	and SR reconstruction filter. A formal expression for the MSE is
	obtained that allows a qualitative study of SR behavior. In particular
	we provide an original outlook on the balance between noise and aliasing
	reduction in linear SR. Explicit account for the SR reconstruction
	filter is an original feature of our model. It allows for the first
	time to study not only optimal filters but also suboptimal ones,
	which are often used in practice. \&copy; 2009 Optical Society of

  abstract = {AbstractIt is well known that the ML estimator exhibits a
	
	threshold effect, i.e., a rapid deterioration of estimation accuracy
	
	below a certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or number of
	
	snapshots. This effect is caused by outliers and is not captured
	
	by standard tools such as the Cramr-Rao bound (CRB). The
	
	search of the SNR threshold value (where the CRB becomes unreliable
	
	for prediction of maximum likelihood estimator variance)
	
	can be achieved with the help of the Barankin bound (BB), as
	
	proposed by many authors. The major drawback of the BB, in
	
	comparison with the CRB, is the absence of a general analytical
	
	formula, which compels one to resort to a discrete form, usually
	
	the McaulaySeidman bound (MSB), requesting the search of an
	
	optimum over a set of test points. In this paper, we propose a new
	
	practical BB discrete form that provides, for a given set of test
	
	points, an improved SNR threshold prediction in comparison with
	
	existing approximations (MSB, Abel bound, McaulayHofstetter
	
	bound) at the expense of the computational complexity increased
	
	by a factor, where is the number of unknown parameters.
	
	We have derived its expression for the general Gaussian
	
	observation model to be used in place of existing approximations},

  abstract = {The driven-equilibrium single-pulse observation of T1 (DESPOT1) and
	T2 (DESPOT2) are rapid, accurate, and precise methods for voxelwise
	determination of the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times.
	A limitation of the methods, however, is the inherent assumption
	of single-component relaxation. In a variety of biological tissues,
	in particular human white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM), the relaxation
	has been shown to be more completely characterized by a summation
	of two or more relaxation components, or species, each believed to
	be associated with unique microanatomical domains or water pools.
	Unfortunately, characterization of these components on a voxelwise,
	whole-brain basis has traditionally been hindered by impractical
	acquisition times. In this work we extend the conventional DESPOT1
	and DESPOT2 approaches to include multicomponent relaxation analysis.
	Following numerical analysis of the new technique, renamed multicomponent
	driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1/T2 (mcDESPOT),
	whole-brain multicomponent T1 and T2 quantification is demonstrated
	in vivo with clinically realistic times of between 16 and 30 min.
	Results obtained from four healthy individuals and two primary progressive

  abstract = {A novel, fully 3D, high-resolution T1 and T2 relaxation time mapping
	method is presented. The method is based on steady-state imaging
	with T1 and T2 information derived from either spoiling or fully
	refocusing the transverse magnetization following each excitation
	pulse. T1 is extracted from a pair of spoiled gradient recalled echo
	(SPGR) images acquired at optimized flip angles. This T1 information
	is combined with two refocused steady-state free precession (SSFP)
	images to determine T2. T1 and T2 accuracy was evaluated against
	inversion recovery (IR) and spin-echo (SE) results, respectively.
	Error within the T1 and T2 maps, determined from both phantom and
	in vivo measurements, is approximately 7\% for T1 between 300 and
	2000 ms and 7\% for T2 between 30 and 150 ms. The efficiency of the
	method, defined as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the final map
	per voxel volume per square root scan time, was evaluated against
	alternative mapping methods. With an efficiency of three times that
	of multipoint IR and three times that of multiecho SE, our combined
	approach represents the most efficient of those examined. Acquisition
	time for a whole brain T1 map (25 x 25 x 10 cm) is less than 8 min
	with 1 mm3 isotropic voxels. An additional 7 min is required for
	an identically sized T2 map and postprocessing time is less than

	fraction (MWF). T2* decay of each voxel at multiple slice locations
	was acquired in fixed human brains using a multigradient-echo (MGRE)
	pulse sequence with alternating readout gradient polarities. Compared
	to prior techniques using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) acquisition,
	the MGRE acquisition approach has: 1) a very short first echo time
	(2 ms) and echo-spacing (1 ms), which allows for the acquisition
	of multiple sampling points during the fast decay of the myelin water
	signal; 2) a low RF duty cycle, which is especially important for
	achieving acceptable specific absorption rate (SAR) levels at high
	field strengths. Multicompartment analysis was then applied to the
	T2* decay in each pixel using a 3-pool model of white matter to detect

  abstract = {Fluorescence molecular tomography is a powerful tool for 3D visualization
	of molecular targets and pathways in vivo in small animals. Owing
	to the high degrees of absorption and scattering of light through
	tissue, the fluorescence tomographic inverse problem is inherently
	ill-posed. In order to improve source localization and the conditioning
	of the light propagation model, multiple sets of data are acquired
	by illuminating the animal surface with different spatial patterns
	of near-infrared light. However, the choice of these patterns in
	most experimental setups is ad hoc and suboptimal. This paper presents
	a systematic approach for designing efficient illumination patterns
	for fluorescence tomography. Our objective here is to determine how
	to optimally illuminate the animal surface so as to maximize the
	information content in the acquired data. We achieve this by improving
	the conditioning of the Fisher information matrix. We parameterize
	the spatial illumination patterns and formulate our problem as a
	constrained optimization problem that, for a fixed number of illumination
	patterns, yields the optimal set of patterns. For geometric insight,
	we used our method to generate a set of three optimal patterns for
	an optically homogeneous, regular geometrical shape and observed
	expected symmetries in the result. We also generated a set of six
	optimal patterns for an optically homogeneous cuboidal phantom set
	up in the transillumination mode. Finally, we computed optimal illumination
	patterns for an optically inhomogeneous realistically shaped mouse
	atlas for different given numbers of patterns. The regularized pseudoinverse
	matrix, generated using the singular value decomposition, was employed
	to reconstruct the point spread function for each set of patterns
	in the presence of a sample fluorescent point source deep inside
	the mouse atlas. We have evaluated the performance of our method
	by examining the singular value spectra as well as plots of average
	spatial resolution versus estimator variance corresponding to different
	illumination schemes. 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in

	(MAP) estimator, and the set theoretic approach using projection
	onto convex sets (POCS). This paper utilizes the above known tools
	to propose a unified methodology toward the more complicated problem
	of superresolution restoration. In the superresolution restoration
	problem, an improved resolution image is restored from several geometrically
	warped, blurred, noisy and downsampled measured images. The superresolution
	restoration problem is modeled and analyzed from the ML, the MAP,
	and POCS points of view, yielding a generalization of the known superresolution
	restoration methods. The proposed restoration approach is general
	but assumes explicit knowledge of the linear space- and time-variant
	blur, the (additive Gaussian) noise, the different measured resolutions,
	and the (smooth) motion characteristics. A hybrid method combining
	the simplicity of the ML and the incorporation of nonellipsoid constraints
	is presented, giving improved restoration performance, compared with
	the ML and the POCS approaches. The hybrid method is shown to converge
	to the unique optimal solution of a new definition of the optimization
	problem. Superresolution restoration from motionless measurements
	is also discussed. Simulations demonstrate the power of the proposed

	to neuroscience, with its use for virtually all functional MRI (fMRI)
	and diffusion imaging of fiber connections in the human brain. EPI
	generates a single 2D image in a fraction of a second; however, it
	requires 23 seconds to acquire multi-slice whole brain coverage for
	fMRI and even longer for diffusion imaging. Here we report on a large
	reduction in EPI whole brain scan time at 3 and 7 Tesla, without
	significantly sacrificing spatial resolution, and while gaining functional
	sensitivity. The multiplexed-EPI (M-EPI) pulse sequence combines
	two forms of multiplexing: temporal multiplexing (<italic>m</italic>)
	utilizing simultaneous echo refocused (SIR) EPI and spatial multiplexing
	(<italic>n</italic>) with multibanded RF pulses (MB) to achieve <italic>m</italic><italic>n</italic>
	images in an EPI echo train instead of the normal single image. This
	resulted in an unprecedented reduction in EPI scan time for whole
	brain fMRI performed at 3 Tesla, permitting TRs of 400 ms and 800
	ms compared to a more conventional 2.5 sec TR, and 24 times reductions
	in scan time for HARDI imaging of neuronal fibertracks. The simultaneous
	SE refocusing of SIR imaging at 7 Tesla advantageously reduced SAR
	by using fewer RF refocusing pulses and by shifting fat signal out
	of the image plane so that fat suppression pulses were not required.
	In preliminary studies of resting state functional networks identified
	through independent component analysis, the 6-fold higher sampling
	rate increased the peak functional sensitivity by 60\%. The novel
	M-EPI pulse sequence resulted in a significantly increased temporal
	resolution for whole brain fMRI, and as such, this new methodology
	can be used for studying non-stationarity in networks and generally
	for expanding and enriching the functional information.</p> },

  abstract = {For MRI with non-Cartesian sampling, the conventional approach to
	reconstructing images is to use the gridding method with a Kaiser-Bessel
	(KB) interpolation kernel. Recently, Sha et al. [L. Sha, H. Guo,
	A.W. Song, An improved gridding method for spiral MRI using nonuniform
	fast Fourier transform, J. Magn. Reson. 162(2) (2003) 250-258] proposed
	an alternative method based on a nonuniform FFT (NUFFT) with least-squares
	(LS) design of the interpolation coefficients. They described this
	LS\_NUFFT method as shift variant and reported that it yielded smaller
	reconstruction approximation errors than the conventional shift-invariant
	KB approach. This paper analyzes the LS\_NUFFT approach in detail.
	We show that when one accounts for a certain linear phase factor,
	the core of the LS\_NUFFT interpolator is in fact real and shift
	invariant. Furthermore, we find that the KB approach yields smaller
	errors than the original LS\_NUFFT approach. We show that optimizing
	certain scaling factors can lead to a somewhat improved LS\_NUFFT

  abstract = {AbstractIn some types of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging,
	
	particularly functional brain scans, the conventional Fourier
	
	model for the measurements is inaccurate. Magnetic field inhomogeneities,
	
	which are caused by imperfect main fields and by
	
	magnetic susceptibility variations, induce distortions in images
	
	that are reconstructed by conventional Fourier methods. These artifacts
	
	hamper the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) in brain
	
	regions near air/tissue interfaces. Recently, iterative methods that
	
	combine the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm with nonuniform
	
	FFT (NUFFT) operations have been shown to provide considerably
	
	improved image quality relative to the conjugate-phase
	
	method. However, for non-Cartesian k-space trajectories, each
	
	CG-NUFFT iteration requires numerous k-space interpolations;
	
	these are operations that are computationally expensive and poorly
	
	suited to fast hardware implementations. This paper proposes a
	
	faster iterative approach to field-corrected MR image reconstruction
	
	based on the CG algorithm and certain Toeplitz matrices.
	
	This CG-Toeplitz approach requires k-space interpolations only
	
	for the initial iteration; thereafter, only fast Fourier transforms
	
	(FFTs) are required. Simulation results show that the proposed
	
	CG-Toeplitz approach produces equivalent image quality as the
	
	CG-NUFFT method with significantly reduced computation time},

  abstract = {Abstract Spatial encoding in MRI is conventionally achieved by the
	application of switchable linear encoding fields. The general concept
	of the recently introduced PatLoc (Parallel Imaging Technique using
	Localized Gradients) encoding is to use nonlinear fields to achieve
	spatial encoding. Relaxing the requirement that the encoding fields
	must be linear may lead to improved gradient performance or reduced
	peripheral nerve stimulation. In this work, a custom-built insert
	coil capable of generating two independent quadratic encoding fields
	was driven with high-performance amplifiers within a clinical MR
	system. In combination with the three linear encoding fields, the
	combined hardware is capable of independently manipulating five spatial
	encoding fields. With the linear z-gradient used for slice-selection,
	there remain four separate channels to encode a 2D-image. To compare
	trajectories of such multidimensional encoding, the concept of a
	local k-space is developed. Through simulations, reconstructions
	using six gradient-encoding strategies were compared, including Cartesian
	encoding separately or simultaneously on both PatLoc and linear gradients
	as well as two versions of a radial-based in/out trajectory. Corresponding
	experiments confirmed that such multidimensional encoding is practically
	achievable and demonstrated that the new radial-based trajectory
	offers the PatLoc property of variable spatial resolution while maintaining
	finite resolution across the entire field-of-view. Magn Reson Med,

	over a period that is 2orders of magnitude longer than the underlying

  abstract = {A computationally simple super-resolution algorithm using a type of
	adaptive Wiener filter is proposed. The algorithm produces an improved
	resolution image from a sequence of low-resolution (LR) video frames
	with overlapping field of view. The algorithm uses subpixel registration
	to position each LR pixel value on a common spatial grid that is
	referenced to the average position of the input frames. The positions
	of the LR pixels are not quantized to a finite grid as with some
	previous techniques. The output high-resolution (HR) pixels are obtained
	using a weighted sum of LR pixels in a local moving window. Using
	a statistical model, the weights for each HR pixel are designed to
	minimize the mean squared error and they depend on the relative positions
	of the surrounding LR pixels. Thus, these weights adapt spatially
	and temporally to changing distributions of LR pixels due to varying
	motion. Both a global and spatially varying statistical model are
	considered here. Since the weights adapt with distribution of LR
	pixels, it is quite robust and will not become unstable when an unfavorable
	distribution of LR pixels is observed. For translational motion,
	the algorithm has a low computational complexity and may be readily
	suitable for real-time and/or near real-time processing applications.
	With other motion models, the computational complexity goes up significantly.
	However, regardless of the motion model, the algorithm lends itself
	to parallel implementation. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm
	is demonstrated here in a number of experimental results using simulated
	and real video sequences. A computational analysis is also presented.

	the resulting images may be severely aliased. This paper examines
	a technique for estimating a high-resolution image, with reduced
	aliasing, from a sequence of undersampled frames. Several approaches
	to this problem have been investigated previously. However, in this
	paper a maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for jointly estimating
	image registration parameters and the high-resolution image is presented.
	Several previous approaches have relied on knowing the registration
	parameters a priori or have utilized registration techniques not
	specifically designed to treat severely aliased images. In the proposed
	method, the registration parameters are iteratively updated along
	with the high-resolution image in a cyclic coordinate-descent optimization
	procedure. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the performance
	of the proposed MAP algorithm using both visible and infrared images.
	Quantitative error analysis is provided and several images are shown
	for subjective evaluation. 1997 IEEE.},

	scan times and low spatial resolution. Recent advances in gradient
	systems hardware allow very rapid imaging sequences, such as steady-state
	free precession (SSFP), which has repetition times (TRs) of 25 ms.
	The design of these rapid sequences demands time-optimal preparatory
	gradient waveforms to provide maximum readout duty-cycle, and preserve
	spatial resolution and SNR while keeping TRs low. Time-optimal gradient
	waveforms can be synthesized analytically for certain simple cases.

	problems for oblique gradient design, spiral imaging, and flow-encoding
	using either a constant slew rate or the more exact voltage-limited

	echoes after the excitation by RF pulses designed to excite a moving

	encoding magnetic fields (SEMs). In combination with parallel local

	of such a parallel imaging technique using localized gradients (PatLoc)-
	system, we present a polar gradient system consisting of 2 8 rectangular
	current loops in octagonal arrangement, which generates a radial
	magnetic field gradient. By inverting the direction of current in
	alternating loops, a near sinusoidal field variation in the circumferential
	direction is produced. Ambiguities in spatial assignment are resolved
	by use of multiple receiver coils and parallel reconstruction. Simulations
	demonstrate the potential advantages and limitations of this approach.
	Results and conclusions: The exact behaviour of PatLoc fields with
	respect to peripheral nerve stimulation needs to be tested in practice.
	Based on geometrical considerations SEMs of radial geometry allow
	for about three times faster gradient switching compared to conventional

  abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/mrm.1910380117.abs In interleaved spiral MRI, an
	object's Fourier transform is sampled along a set of curved trajectories
	in the spatial frequency domain (k-space). An image of the object
	is then reconstructed, usually by interpolating the sampled Fourier
	data onto a Cartesian grid and applying the fast Fourier transform
	(FFT) algorithm. To obtain accurate results, it is necessary to account
	for the nonuniform density with which k-space is sampled. An analytic
	density compensation function (DCF) for spiral MRI, based on the
	Jacobian determinant for the transformation between Cartesian coordinates
	and the spiral sampling parameters of time and interleaf rotation
	angle, is derived in this paper, and the reconstruction accuracy
	achieved using this function is compared with that obtained using
	several previously published expressions. Various non-ideal conditions,
	including intersecting trajectories, are considered. The new DCF
	eliminated intensity cupping that was encountered in images reconstructed
	with other functions, and significantly reduced the level of artifact
	observed when unevenly spaced sampling trajectories, such as those
	achieved with trapezoidal gradient waveforms, were employed. Modified
	forms of this function were found to provide similar improvements
	when intersecting trajectories made the spiral-Cartesian transformation
	noninvertible, and when the shape of the spiral trajectory varied
	between interleaves.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion imaging is potentially an important tool
	for the noninvasive characterization of normal and pathological tissue.
	The technique, however, is prone to a number of artifacts that can
	severely affect its ability to provide clinically useful information.
	In this study, the problem of eddy current-induced geometric distortions
	that occur in diffusion images acquired with echo planar sequences
	was addressed. These geometric distortions produce artifacts in computed
	maps of diffusion parameters and are caused by misalignments in the
	individual diffusion-weighted images that comprise the diffusion
	data set. A new approach is presented to characterize and calibrate
	the eddy current effects, enabling the eddy current distortions to
	be corrected in sets of Interleaved (or snapshot) echo planar diffusion
	images. Correction is achieved by acquiring one-dimensional field
	maps in the read and phase encode direction for each slice and each
	diffusion step. The method is then demonstrated through the correction
	of distortions in diffusion images of the human brain. It is shown
	that by using the eddy current correction scheme outlined, the eddy
	current-induced artifacts in the diffusion-weighted images are almost
	completely eliminated. In addition, there is a significant improvement
	in the quality of the resulting diffusion tensor maps.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the values for relaxation times in human brain
	for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 4 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
	T1 measurements were made with a progressive saturation sequence,
	an implementation of the Look-Locker sequence, and an inversion-recovery
	(IR) interleaved echo-planar imaging (IEPI) sequence. T2 measurements
	were made with a standard spin-echo (SE) sequence and an SE IEPI
	sequence. RESULTS: The T1 measurements yielded values of 1,724 msec
	+/- 51 for gray matter, 1,043 msec +/- 27 for white matter, and 4,550
	msec +/- 800 msec for cerebrospinal fluid. The deep gray matter regions
	had T1 values of 1,458 +/- 38 (caudate nucleus) and 1,372 +/- 60
	(putamen). The T2 measurements yielded results of 63 msec +/- 6.2
	for gray matter and 49.8 msec +/- 2.2 for white matter. CONCLUSION:
	The T1 values measured at 4 T show a higher value than predicted
	from extrapolation at lower field strengths. The T2 measurements
	showed a slight decrease in values over those measured at lower-field
	strength. The gain in signal-to-noise ratio from the higher field
	strength may be substantially offset by these altered relaxation
	time values to a degree that is sequence dependent},

	A new algorithm was developed to calculate optimized coefficients

	myelin water signal. A set of simulations showed the new technique
	was accurate over a broad range of myelin water signal. The myelin
	water fraction from brain regions in scans from five volunteers,
	estimated by the linear combination method, agreed with the myelin
	water fraction estimated by the standard technique. The strength
	of the new technique is that the linear combination does not assume

  abstract = {This paper discusses the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) problem:
	electric currents are injected into a body with unknown electromagnetic
	properties through a set of contact electrodes. The corresponding
	voltages that are needed to maintain these currents are measured.
	The objective is to estimate the unknown resistivity, or more generally
	the impedivity distribution of the body based on this information.
	The most commonly used method to tackle this problem in practice
	is to use gradient-based local linearizations. We give a proof for
	the differentiability of the electrode boundary data with respect
	to the resistivity distribution and the contact impedances. Due to
	the ill-posedness of the problem, regularization has to be employed.
	In this paper, we consider the EIT problem in the framework of Bayesian
	statistics, where the inverse problem is recast into a form of statistical
	inference. The problem is to estimate the posterior distribution
	of the unknown parameters conditioned on measurement data. From the
	posterior density, various estimates for the resistivity distribution
	can be calculated as well as a posteriori uncertainties. The search
	of the maximum a posteriori estimate is typically an optimization
	problem, while the conditional expectation is computed by integrating
	the variable with respect to the posterior probability distribution.
	In practice, especially when the dimension of the parameter space
	is large, this integration must be done by Monte Carlo methods such
	as the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. These methods
	can also be used for calculation of a posteriori uncertainties for
	the estimators. In this paper, we concentrate on MCMC integration
	methods. In particular, we demonstrate by numerical examples the
	statistical approach when the prior densities are nondifferentiable,
	such as the prior penalizing the total variation or the L<sup>1</sup>
	norm of the resistivity .},

	the partial-volume effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is important,

	An algebraic calculation, which accommodates this constant, offers
	improved T2 estimation speed over the commonly used non-linear fitting
	approach. Our objective was to compare the algebraic approach against
	three fitting approaches for the detection of seizure related abnormalities.
	We tested the performance of the four methods in the presence of

	a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence from 45 healthy subjects and
	24 patients with confirmed right temporal lobe epilepsy. A quantitative
	analysis was performed on spatially normalized data by measuring
	T2 in various regions and with a whole brain tissue segmentation
	analysis. The detection rate of hippocampal T2 changes in patients
	was assessed by comparing the regional T2 measurements from each
	patient against the control data with a z-score threshold of 2.33.
	The algebraic method yielded high sensitivity for detection of hippocampal
	abnormalities in the epileptic patients in regional assessment and
	in follow-up single-subject VBR. This can be attributed to the relatively
	small variance across healthy subjects and improved precision in
	the presence of CSF and noise in simulation. In conclusion, the algebraic
	method is better than fitting based on faster calculation speed and
	better sensitivity for detecting seizure-related T2 changes.},

	fractions followed that predicted by the theoretical myelination
	model in both brain areas. The myelinated-axon and mixed pool sizes
	were significantly different in the two WM areas following early
	myelination, although their myelin pools were similar. T1 values

	reduce scan times in parallel MRI by enabling the utilization of
	a large number of RF strip detectors that are inherently decoupled,
	and are tuned by adjusting the strip length to integer multiples
	of a quarter-wavelength (/4) in the presence of a ground plane and
	dielectric substrate. In addition, the more explicit spatial information
	embedded in the phase of the signals from the strip array is advantageous
	(compared to loop arrays) for limiting aliasing artifacts in parallel
	MRI. However, losses in the detector as its natural resonance frequency
	approaches the Larmor frequency (where the wavelength is long at
	1.5 T) may limit the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the PSA. Moreover,
	the PSA's inherent /4 structure severely limits our ability to adjust
	detector geometry to optimize the performance for a specific organ
	system, as is done with loop coils. In this study we replaced the
	dielectric substrate with discrete capacitors, which resulted in
	both SNR improvement and a tunable lumped-element PSA (LPSA) whose
	dimensions can be optimized within broad constraints, for a given
	region of interest (ROI) and MRI frequency. A detailed theoretical
	analysis of the LPSA is presented, including its equivalent circuit,
	electromagnetic fields, SNR, and g-factor maps for parallel MRI.
	Two different decoupling schemes for the LPSA are described. A four-element

	on images obtained with parallel and conventional acquisition schemes.

	for water protons (in separate myelin and intra/extracellular compartments)

	to gain insight into the observations from multicomponent quantitative

	based on simplified white matter models and experimentally feasible

  abstract = {MRI is widely used for noninvasive hemodynamic-based functional brain
	imaging. In traditional spatial encoding, however, gradient switching
	limits the temporal resolution, which makes it difficult to unambiguously
	identify possible fast nonhemodynamic changes. In this paper we propose
	a novel reconstruction approach, called dynamic inverse imaging (InI),
	that is capable of providing millisecond temporal resolution when
	highly parallel detection is used. To achieve an order-of-magnitude
	speedup in generating time-resolved contrast estimates and dynamic
	statistical parametric maps (dSPMs), the spatial information is derived
	from an array of detectors rather than by time-consuming gradient-encoding
	methods. The InI approach was inspired by electroencephalography
	(EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) source localization techniques.
	Dynamic MR InI was evaluated by means of numerical simulations. InI
	was also applied to measure BOLD hemodynamic time curves at 20-ms
	temporal resolution in a visual stimulation experiment using a 90-channel
	head array. InI is expected to improve the time resolution of MRI
	and provide increased flexibility in the trade-off between spatial

	the combination of surface gradient coils generating nonbijective
	curvilinear magnetic fields for spatial encoding. PatLoc imaging
	using one pair of multipolar spatial encoding magnetic fields (SEMs)
	has two major caveats: (1) The direct inversion of the encoding matrix
	requires exact determination of multiple locations which are ambiguously
	encoded by the SEMs. (2) Reconstructed images have a prominent loss
	of spatial resolution at the center of field-of-view using a symmetric
	coil array for signal detection. This study shows that a PatLoc system
	actually has a higher degree of freedom in spatial encoding to mitigate
	the two challenges mentioned above. Specifically, a PatLoc system
	can generate not only multipolar but also linear SEMs, which can
	be used to reduce the loss of spatial resolution at the field-of-view
	center. Here, we present an efficient and generalized image reconstruction
	method for PatLoc imaging using multiple SEMs without explicitly
	identifying the locations where SEM encoding is not unique. Reconstructions

	those using conventional linear gradients to demonstrate that the

	According to the recently developed mathematical theory of Compressed-Sensing

	aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random
	variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction
	is performed by minimizing the L1 norm of a transformed image, subject

  abstract = {T2 weighting is particularly sensitive, but notoriously unspecific,
	to a wide range of brain pathologies. However, careful measurement
	and analysis of the T2 decay curve from brain tissue promise to provide
	much improved pathological specificity. In vivo T2 measurement requires
	accurate 180 pulses and appropriate manipulation of stimulated echoes;
	the most common approach is to acquire multiple echoes from a single
	slice. The T2 distribution, a plot of component amplitude as a function
	of T2, can be estimated using an algorithm capable of fitting a multi-exponential
	T2 decay with no a priori assumptions about the number of exponential
	components. T2 distributions from normal brain show peaks from myelin
	water, intra/extracellular water and cerebral spinal fluid; they
	can be used to provide estimates of total water content (total area
	under the T2 distribution) and myelin water fraction (MWF, fractional
	area under the myelin water peak), a measure believed to be related
	to myelin content. Experiments on bovine brain suggest that magnetization
	exchange between water pools plays a minor role in the T2 distribution.
	Different white matter structures have different MWFs. In normal
	white matter (NWM), MWF is not correlated with the magnetization
	transfer ratio (MTR) or the diffusion tensor fractional anisotropy
	(FA); hence it provides unique information about brain microstructure.
	Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) brain
	possesses a higher water content and lower MWF than controls, consistent
	with histopathological findings. Multiple sclerosis lesions demonstrate
	great heterogeneity in MWF, presumably due to varying myelin contents
	of these focal regions of pathology. Subjects with schizophrenia
	were found to have significantly reduced MWF in the minor forceps
	and genu of the corpus callosum when compared to controls, suggesting
	that reduced frontal lobe myelination plays a role in schizophrenia.
	In normal controls, frontal lobe myelination was positively correlated
	with both age and education; this result was not observed in subjects
	with schizophrenia. A strong correlation between MWF and the optical
	density from the luxol fast blue histological stain for myelin was
	observed in formalin-fixed brain, supporting the use of the MWF as

	problems, the ability to create a wide class of machines that are
	designed for specific anatomy-related applications, the ability to
	design open machines for physician access, and improved capability
	for high speed imaging. Generic to all of the methods presented are
	a pulsed polarizing field and an oscillatory readout bias field.
	The pulsed field initially polarizes the magnetic moments. Sinat
	it is not on during the readout operation it has negligible homogeneity
	requirements since changes in the field amplitude will merely shade
	the image intensity. During readout a relatively low bias field is
	used. To enable the use of a relatively inhomogeneous bias field,
	an osciliatory field is used that has a zero average value. This
	prevents any long-term buildup of phase errors due to a frequency
	error associated with inhomogeneity. Thus the average bias frequency
	will be determined solely by the frequency rather than the amplitude
	of the bias field. Three methods are described, all including the
	above features. The first two involve imaging in the laboratory frame,
	while the third involves imaging in the rotating frame. The second
	approach requires no RF excitation and the third approach uses RF

	multislice acquisitions for assessment of both the stimulated echo

	inaccuracy.ResultsPhantom experiments demonstrated that substantial
	inaccuracy (10\%13\% longer T2 values) is introduced from stimulated
	echoes with a multiecho sequence with slice-selective refocusing
	pulses. The in vivo volunteer studies also demonstrated increases
	in measured T2 by up to 48\% with a multiecho sequence. Use of the
	multiecho sequence in the multislice mode resulted in T2 values closer

  abstract = {Super-resolution (SR)-based methods that implement multiple data sets
	related by spatial translations in the frequency-encoding (FE) direction
	have recently been proposed for resolution enhancement in MRI. This
	approach, however, was initially received with controversy. It was
	suggested that when the shifts are applied in the FE direction, no
	new information was acquired after the first image. Recent developments
	suggest, however, that shifting the object between image acquisitions
	can introduce new information to each data set. For this reason,
	SRMRI may be possible in the FE direction. In this article, we point
	out that the presence of new information in each acquisition is not
	sufficient for an SR algorithm to be practical. Indeed, there are
	situations where the amount of new information is relatively small
	and possibly not even measurable in the presence of noise. We explore
	the question of how much new information can be present in each acquisition
	for FE SRMRI. In particular, we investigate the extent to which the
	effect of the spatial shift - applied before the object is imaged
	- can be undone using simple image-processing techniques. Visual
	comparisons and numerical measures are used to characterize the amount
	of new information that is acquired in each data set. It is shown
	that since the amount of new information can be relatively small,
	each image can be approximated by applying simple signal-processing
	techniques to a single data set. Ultimately, our research suggests
	that little progress may be possible by using this approach to perform
	resolution enhancement in the FE direction. 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

	the full spatial variation of the imaging encoding gradient field

	contribution. In addition, error-compensation schemes can be introduced

	the electromagnetic field to minimize total power deposition while
	maintaining a constant right-hand circularly polarized component
	of the magnetic field at the point of interest. A numerical approximation
	for the optimal field is found by assuming a superposition of a large
	number of plane waves. This simulation allowed estimation of the
	ultimate intrinsic SNR attainable in a human torso model. The performance
	of six coil configurations was evaluated by comparing the SNR of
	images obtained by the coils with the ultimate values. In addition,
	the behavior of ultimate intrinsic SNR was investigated as a function
	of main field strength. It was found that the ultimate intrinsic
	SNR increases better than linearly with the main magnetic field up
	to 10 T for our model. It was observed that for field strengths of
	4 T or higher, focusing is required to reach the ultimate intrinsic
	SNR.},

	Methods. Eighty-nine patients with, or at risk of, MS (69 relapsing

	MWF in white matter for controls was 11.3\%. Mean MWF was significantly
	reduced in NAWM of MS patients (10.6\%, P= .004) relative to controls.
	SPMS/RRMS patients with disease duration >5 years (10.3\%) had lower

	the spatial encoding capabilities of coil arrays in parallel MRI.
	Ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), independent of any

	coil sensitivities in terms of a complete set of basis functions
	that satisfy Maxwell's equations within the sample and performing
	parallel imaging reconstructions using these basis functions. The
	dependence of the ultimate intrinsic SNR on a variety of experimental
	conditions is explored and a physically intuitive explanation for
	the observed behavior is provided based on a comparison between the
	electromagnetic wavelength and the distance between aliasing points.
	Imaging at high field strength, with correspondingly short wavelength,
	is shown to offer advantages for parallel imaging beyond those already
	expected due to the larger available spin polarization. One-dimensional
	undersampling of k-space yields a steep drop in attainable SNR for
	more than a 5-fold reduction of scan time, while 2D undersampling
	permits access to much higher degrees of acceleration. Increased
	tissue conductivity decreases baseline SNR, but improves parallel

  abstract = {Shannon's sampling theory and its variants provide effective solutions
	to the problem of reconstructing a signal from its samples in some
	"shift-invariant" space, which may or may not be bandlimited. In
	this paper, we present some further justification for this type of
	representation, while addressing the issue of the specification of
	the best reconstruction space. We consider a realistic setting where
	a multidimensional signal is prefiltered prior to sampling, and the
	samples are corrupted by additive noise. We adopt a variational approach
	to the reconstruction problem and minimize a data fidelity term subject
	to a Tikhonov-like (continuous domain) L<sub>2</sub>-regularization
	to obtain the continuous-space solution. We present theoretical justification
	for the minimization of this cost functional and show that the globally
	minimal continuous-space solution belongs to a shift-invariant space
	generated by a function (generalized B-spline) that is generally
	not bandlimited. When the sampling is ideal, we recover some of the
	classical smoothing spline estimators. The optimal reconstruction
	space is characterized by a condition that links the generating function
	to the regularization operator and implies the existence of a B-spline-like
	basis. To make the scheme practical, we specify the generating functions
	corresponding to the most popular families of regularization operators
	(derivatives, iterated Laplacian), as well as a new, generalized
	one that leads to a new brand of Matrn splines. We conclude the paper
	by proposing a stochastic interpretation of the reconstruction algorithm
	and establishing an equivalence with the minimax and minimum mean
	square error (MMSE/Wiener) solutions of the generalized sampling
	problem. 2008 IEEE.},

	each basis exponential ldquo;selecting rdquo; signal exponents that
	are close to its own and ldquo;rejecting rdquo; others. The first
	part of the paper is concerned with determining such basis sets.
	The authors take a single-exponential test signal, analyze it in
	terms of the basis exponentials, and consider each fitted amplitude
	as a function of test exponent. Each such function is then required
	to peak in a manner familiar to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)

	data, such selective bases exist and are uniquely determined by model
	order and sampling interval. Formulas for basis decay rates and fitting
	amplitudes are obtained in closed form. It is shown that a time-bandwidth
	relationship also holds. However, the selective basis set turns out
	to be unacceptably sensitive to noise. The second part of the paper

	The canonical case study is that of incoherent imaging of two closely-spaced

	how far beyond the classical Rayleigh limit of resolution one can
	reach at a given signal to noise ratio. The analysis uses tools from
	statistical detection and estimation theory. Specifically, we will
	derive explicit relationships between the minimum detectable distance
	between two closely-spaced point sources imaged incoherently at a
	given SNR. For completeness, asymptotic performance analysis for
	the estimation of the unknown parameters is carried out using the
	Cramr-Rao bound. To gain maximum intuition, the analysis is carried
	out in one dimension, but can be well extended to the two-dimensional

  abstract = {Cramer-Rao bounds on estimation accuracy are established for estimation
	problems on arbitrary manifolds in which no set of intrinsic coordinates
	exists. The frequently encountered examples of estimating either
	an unknown subspace or a covariance matrix are examined in detail.
	The set of subspaces, called the Grassmann manifold, and the set
	of covariance (positive-definite Hermitian) matrices have no fixed
	coordinate system associated with them and do not possess a vector
	space structure, both of which are required for deriving classical
	Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds. Intrinsic versions of the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound
	on manifolds utilizing an arbitrary affine connection with arbitrary
	geodesics are derived for both biased and unbiased estimators. In
	the example of covariance matrix estimation, closed-form expressions
	for both the intrinsic and flat bounds are derived and compared with
	the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the sample covariance matrix
	(SCM) estimator for varying sample support K. The accuracy bound
	on unbiased covariance matrix estimators is shown to be about (10/log
	10)n/K<sup>1/2</sup> dB, where n is the matrix order. Remarkably,
	it is shown that from an intrinsic perspective, the SCM is a biased
	and inefficient estimator and that the bias term reveals the dependency
	of estimation accuracy on sample support observed in theory and practice.
	The RMSE of the standard method of estimating subspaces using the
	singular value decomposition (SVD) is compared with the intrinsic
	subspace Cramr-Rao bound derived in closed form by varying both the
	signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the unknown p-dimensional subspace
	and the sample support. In the simplest case, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao
	bound on subspace estimation accuracy is shown to be about (p(n -
	p))<sup>1/2</sup>K<sup>-1/2</sup>SNH<sup>-1/2</sup> rad for p-dimensional
	subspaces. It is seen that the SVD-based method yields accuracies
	very close to the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, establishing that the principal
	invariant subspace of a random sample provides an excellent estimator
	of an unknown subspace. The analysis approach developed is directly
	applicable to many other estimation problems on manifolds encountered
	in signal processing and elsewhere, such as estimating rotation matrices
	in computer vision and estimating subspace basis vectors in blind

  abstract = {Radially encoded MRI has gained increasing attention due to its motion
	insensitivity and reduced artifacts. However, because its samples
	are collected nonuniformly in the k-space, multidimensional (especially
	3-D) radially sampled MRI image reconstruction is challenging. The
	objective of this paper is to develop a reconstruction technique
	in high dimensions with on-the-fly kernel calculation. It implements
	general multidimensional nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT)
	algorithms and incorporates them into a k-space image reconstruction
	framework. The method is then applied to reconstruct from the radially
	encoded k-space data, although the method is applicable to any non-Cartesian
	patterns. Performance comparisons are made against the conventional
	Kaiser-Bessel (KB) gridding method for 2-D and 3-D radially encoded
	computer-simulated phantoms and physically scanned phantoms. The
	results show that the NUFFT reconstruction method has better accuracy-efficiency
	tradeoff than the KB gridding method when the kernel weights are
	calculated on the fly. It is found that for a particular conventional
	kernel function, using its corresponding deapodization function as
	a scaling factor in the NUFFT framework has the potential to improve
	accuracy. In particular, when a cosine scaling factor is used, the
	NUFFT method is faster than KB gridding method since a closed-form
	solution is available and is less computationally expensive than
	the KB kernel (KB griding requires computation of Bessel functions).
	The NUFFT method has been successfully applied to 2-D and 3-D in
	vivo studies on small animals.},

	algorithms appear particularly promising since they enable accurate
	physical noise modeling. The newly developed compressive sampling/compressed
	sensing (CS) algorithm has shown the potential to accurately reconstruct
	images from highly undersampled data. The CS algorithm can be implemented
	in the statistical reconstruction framework as well. In this study,
	we compared the performance of two standard statistical reconstruction
	algorithms (penalized weighted least squares and q-GGMRF) to the
	CS algorithm. In assessing the image quality using these iterative
	reconstructions, it is critical to utilize realistic background anatomy
	as the reconstruction results are object dependent. A cadaver head
	was scanned on a Varian Trilogy system at different dose levels.
	Several figures of merit including the relative root mean square
	error and a quality factor which accounts for the noise performance
	and the spatial resolution were introduced to objectively evaluate
	reconstruction performance. A comparison is presented between the
	three algorithms for a constant undersampling factor comparing different
	algorithms at several dose levels. To facilitate this comparison,
	the original CS method was formulated in the framework of the statistical
	image reconstruction algorithms. Important conclusions of the measurements
	from our studies are that (1) for realistic neuro-anatomy, over 100
	projections are required to avoid streak artifacts in the reconstructed
	images even with CS reconstruction, (2) regardless of the algorithm
	employed, it is beneficial to distribute the total dose to more views
	as long as each view remains quantum noise limited and (3) the total
	variation-based CS method is not appropriate for very low dose levels
	because while it can mitigate streaking artifacts, the images exhibit
	patchy behavior, which is potentially harmful for medical diagnosis.},

  year = {2010},
  volume = {21},
  pages = {232--244},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {The objective of super-resolution (SR) imaging is to reconstruct a
	single higher-resolution image based on a set of lower-resolution
	images that were acquired from the same scene to overcome the limitations
	of image acquisition process for facilitating better visualization
	and content recognition. In this paper, a stochastic Markov chain
	Monte Carlo (MCMC) SR image reconstruction approach is proposed.
	First, a Bayesian inference formulation, which is based on the observed
	low-resolution images and the prior high-resolution image model,
	is mathematically derived. Second, to exploit the MCMC sample-generation
	technique for the stochastic SR image reconstruction, three fundamental
	issues are observed as follows. First, since the hyperparameter value
	of the prior image model controls the degree of regularization and
	intimately affects the quality of the reconstructed high-resolution
	image, how to determine an optimal hyperparameter value for different
	low-resolution input images becomes a very challenging task. Rather
	than exploiting the exhaustive search, an iterative updating approach
	is developed in this paper by allowing the value of hyperparameter
	being simultaneously updated in each sample-generation iteration.
	Second, the samples generated during the so-called burn-in period
	(measured in terms of the number of samples initially generated)
	of the MCMC-based sample-generation process are considered unreliable
	and should be discarded. To determine the length of the burn-in period
	for each set of low-resolution input images, a time-period bound
	in closed form is mathematically derived. Third, image artifacts
	could be incurred in the reconstructed high-resolution image, if
	the number of samples (counting after the burn-in period) generated
	by the MCMC-based sample-generation process is insufficient. For
	that, a variation-sensitive bilateral filter is proposed as a 'complementary'
	post-processing scheme, to improve the reconstructed high-resolution
	image quality, when the number of samples is insufficient. Extensive
	simulation results have clearly shown that the proposed stochastic
	SR image reconstruction method consistently yields superior performance.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm for enhancing the
	resolution of monochrome and color image sequences. Various approaches
	toward motion estimation are investigated and compared. Improving
	the spatial resolution of an image sequence critically depends upon
	the accuracy of the motion estimator. The problem is complicated
	by the fact that the motion field is prone to significant errors
	since the original high-resolution images are not available. Improved
	motion estimates may be obtained by using a more robust and accurate
	motion estimator, such as a pel-recursive scheme instead of block
	matching. In processing color image sequences, there is the added
	advantage of having more flexibility in how the final motion estimates
	are obtained, and further improvement in the accuracy of the motion
	field is therefore possible. This is because there are three different
	intensity fields (channels) conveying the same motion information.
	In this paper, the choice of which motion estimator to use versus
	how the final estimates are obtained is weighed to see which issue
	is more critical in improving the estimated high-resolution sequences.
	Toward this end, an iterative algorithm is proposed, and two sets
	of experiments are presented. First, several different experiments
	using the same motion estimator but three different data fusion approaches
	to merge the individual motion fields were performed. Second, estimated
	high-resolution images using the block matching estimator were compared
	to those obtained by employing a pel recursive scheme. Experiments
	were performed on a real color image sequence, and performance was
	measured by the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).},

	the use of a multislice spin-echo technique, a background phase correction,

	Moreover, they are not restricted by any assumptions which limit

	due to the finite number of inaccurate measurements means that a

	equally well. For a complete interpretation the range of possible

	represents the physical system under investigation and so enhance
	the reliability of the interpretation. This flexibility is essential
	in order to avoid the pitfalls of interpreting a single spectrum

	approach reduces the non-uniqueness by constructing unique information

	model object, it is shown that the behavior of the ultimate SNR imposes
	distinct limits on the acceleration rate in parallel imaging. For
	low and moderate acceleration, the ultimate SNR performance is nearly
	optimal, with geometry factors close to 1. However, for high reduction
	factors beyond a critical value, the ultimate performance deteriorates

	The transition from optimal to deteriorating performance depends

	In the near-field regime, i.e., for low B-o and small object size,
	the critical reduction factor is constant and approximately equal
	to four for 1D acceleration in the sphere. In the far-field wave

  abstract = {While MRI at very low magnetic fields has certain potential advantages,
	it may also face problems that are not typical for MRI at conventional
	and high field (0.110 T). Major differences arise due to the presence
	of concomitant components of inhomogeneous magnetic field (gradients)
	that are transverse to the major Bz field, B0. These concomitant
	transverse field components are inevitably generated by the same
	gradient coils that generate desired Bz imaging gradients as routinely
	used in MRI for spatial encoding. In the hypothetical case (linear
	spatial variation of Bz field amplitude due to the imaging gradients,
	no concomitant transverse field components, no B0 and B1 field inhomogeneities,
	etc.), Fourier transform MRI preserves the shape of the real object
	being examined. It is demonstrated herein that unavoidable concomitant
	transverse field gradients, G, result in an image deformation of
	the object!s actual shape by bending straight lines and planes with
	a characteristic curvature radius Rc = B0/G. For imaging gradients
	on the order of 10 mT/m and B0 of 1 T, the radius Rc is about 100
	m and image distortions are generally negligible. However, for B0
	of 1 mT, Rc is 10 cm, which is less than a typical FOV in human studies.
	This manuscript derives expressions describing geometrical relationships
	between the imaged object and the obtained MR data. In addition to
	geometrical distortions, image intensity will be modulated in a complex,
	spatially dependent manner. Hence, if unaccounted for, corresponding
	image distortionsgeometry and
	
	intensitywill create substantial difficulties in very low field image
	interpretation.},

  abstract = {BMD is commonly obtained with DXA, but this is confounded by the length
	and composition of tissues that the X-ray must traverse. Subpixel
	enhancement of nonuniform tissue (SPENT) is a novel MRI technique
	that can provide (direction specific) information based on the subvoxel
	structural uniformity of a sample. We hypothesized that the SPENT
	signal would be related to BMD. This hypothesis was tested using
	(1) 2D computer simulation of a simplified bone structure and (2)
	in vitro experiments. Simulation results suggested that a resolution
	of 610–800 $\mu$m was required for SPENT to be correlated well
	with the simulated bone volume fraction (BVF) and, at this resolution,
	a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR > 5) was required for reasonable
	data quality. For the experiments, 15-mm3 human trabecular bone samples
	were used (1) to quantify BMD (through both physical measurement
	and DXA) and (2) to perform MRI on a 7T system. Standard and SPENT
	images were obtained. Normalized SPENT (NSPENT) images were calculated
	by pixel-by-pixel division of the SPENT images by the standard proton
	density images to remove any dependence on proton density and coil
	uniformity from the SPENT images. The average NSPENT values were
	determined over the sample volume and compared with the reference
	BMD measurements. Each of the individual NSPENT directions was highly
	correlated with BMD (x-NSPENT, R2 = 0.73, p < 0.001; y-NSPENT, R2
	= 0.76, p < 0.001; z-NSPENT, R2 = 0.89, p < 0.001). With all three
	individual NSPENT directions combined, the correlation with BMD was
	found to be the highest (xyz-NSPENT, R2 = 0.95, p < 0.001). The results
	suggest that the SPENT technique can provide a noninvasive measure

	Two promising approaches to correct the distortion in EPI are field

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
	statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
	because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
	nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based
	model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information
	is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined
	images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not
	the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias
	field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
	produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden
	Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated
	by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which
	can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically,
	it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the
	HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way
	in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences
	of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in
	MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods
	are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based
	approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show
	that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into
	a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved.
	More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with
	other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction
	algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into
	this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach
	for brain MR image segmentation.},

	experimental methods (about 113 and 170 ms before and after being

  abstract = {The Gabor scheme is generalized to incorporate several window functions
	as well as kernels other than the exponential. The properties of
	the sequence of representation functions are characterized by an
	approach based on the concept of frames. Utilizing the piecewise
	Zak transform (PZT), the frame operator associated with the multiwindow
	Gabor-type frame is examined for a rational oversampling rate by
	representing the frame operator as a finite-order matrix-valued function
	in the PZT domain. Completeness and frame properties of the sequence
	of representation functions are examined in relation to the properties
	of the matrix-valued function. Calculations of the frame bounds and
	the dual frame, as well as the issue of tight frames, are considered.
	It is shown that the properties of the sequence of representation
	functions are essentially not changed by replacing the widely used
	exponential kernel with other kernels. Some examples and the issue
	of a different sampling rate for each window are also considered.
	The so-called Balian-Low theorem is generalized to consideration
	of a scheme of multiwindows which makes it possible to overcome in
	a way the constraint imposed by the original theorem in the case
	of a single Window. 1997 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {The mathematical principles of near-optimal two-dimensional spatial
	encoding for dynamically adaptive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
	are presented together with a survey of numerical methods applicable
	for the computation of these encodes. Two main classes of linear
	algebraic techniques are identified - rank revealing orthogonal decompositions
	and Krylov subspace methods - that are specially suited for the determination
	of efficient adaptive non-Fourier spatial encoding. Simulation results
	are presented to demonstrate usage. The key property of these methods
	is their ability to compute reduced vector basis sets, used as encoding
	profiles, that span the column and row vectcr subspaces of an image
	estimate array. Efficient encoding in MRI is possible since MR images
	typically represent rank deficient matrices. New methods for computing
	hybrid encodings based on near-optimal encodes are also described.
	An analysis of the applicability and efficiency of near-optimal encoding
	is presented using the principal angles between vector basis sets
	of the theoretical ideal image and that from an image estimate actually
