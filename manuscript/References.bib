abstract = {Chemical shift imaging (CSI) often suffers from the inconvenient shape
of its spatial response function (SRF), which affects both localization
and signal-to-noise ratio. Replacing the magnetic field gradients
for phase encoding by higher order magnetic fields allows a better
adjustment of the SRF to the structures in the sample. We combined
this principle with the SLOOP (spectral localization with optimal
pointspread function) technique to simultaneously obtain spectra
from several arbitrarily shaped compartments within a sample. Linear
combinations of the fields of the shim coils are used to generate
the pulsed fields for phase encoding. Their shapes are matched to
the given sample geometry by numerical optimization. Using this method,
spectra from a phantom were obtained that show a higher signal-to-noise
ratio and a strongly reduced contamination compared to an equivalent
CSI experiment.},

abstract = {Maxwell's equations imply that imaging gradients are accompanied by
higher order spatially varying fields (concomitant fields) that can
cause artifacts in MR imaging. The lowest order concomitant fields
depend quadratically on the imaging gradient amplitude and inversely
on the static field strength. Time-varying concomitant fields that
accompany the readout gradients of spiral scans cause unwanted phase
accumulation during the readout, resulting in spatially dependent
blurring. Concomitant field phase errors are independent of echo
time and, therefore, cannot be detected using Dixon-type field map
measurements that are normally used to deblur spiral scan images.
Data acquisition methods that reduce concomitant field blurring increase
off-resonant spin blurring, and vice versa. Blurring caused by concomitant
fields can be removed by variations of image reconstruction methods
developed to correct for spatially dependent resonance offsets with
nonrectangular k-space trajectories. Magn Reson Med 41:103-112, 1999.

abstract = {Underlying the exquisite soft tissue contrast provided by magnetic
resonance imaging are the inherent biophysical processes of relaxation.
Through the intricate relationships between tissue microstructure
and biochemistry and the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates,
quantitative measurement of these relaxation parameters is informative
of tissue change associated with disease, neural plasticity, and
other biological processes. Quantitative imaging studies can further
facilitate more detailed characterizations of tissue, providing a
more direct link between modern MR imaging and classic histochemical
and histological studies. In this chapter, we briefly review the
biophysical basis of relaxation, introducing and focusing specifically
on the T 1 , T 2 , and T 2 * relaxation times and detail some of
the more widely used and clinically feasible techniques for their
in vivo measurement. Methods for analyzing relaxation data are covered,
and a summary of significant results from reported neuroimaging studies
is provided. Finally, the combination of relaxation time data with
other quantitative imaging data, including diffusion tensor and magnetization
transfer, is examined, with the aim of providing more thorough characterization
of brain tissue.},

abstract = {Repeatability of in vivo measurement of multicomponent T2* relaxation
in articular cartialges in human knee is important to clinical use.
This study evaluated the repeatability of two-component T2* relaxation
on seven healthy human subjects. The left knee was scanned once a
day in three consecutive days, on a clinical 3T MRI scanner with
eight-channel knee coil and ultrashort echo time pulse sequence at
11 echo times = 0.640 ms. The intrasubject and intersubject repeatability
was evaluated via coefficient of variation (CV = standard deviation/mean)
in four typical cartilage regions: patellar, anterior articular,
femoral, and tibial regions. It was found that the intrasubject repeatability
was good, with CV < 10\% for the short- and long-T2* relaxation time
in the layered regions in the four cartilages (with one exception)
and CV < 13\% for the component intensity fraction (with two exceptions).
The intersubject repeatability was also good, with CV 8\% (range
115\%) for the short- and long-T2* relaxation time and CV 10\%
(range 220\%) for the component intensity fraction. The long-T2*
component showed significantly better repeatability (CV 8\%) than
the short-T2* component (CV12\%) (P < 0.005). These CV values suggest
that in vivo measurement of two-component T2* relaxation in the knee
cartilages is repeatable on clinical scanner at 3 T, with a signal-to-noise

abstract = {Multiple undersampled images of a scene are often obtained by using
a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector array of sensors that are
shifted relative to each other by subpixel displacements. This geometry
of sensors, where each sensor has a subarray of sensing elements
of suitable size, has been popular in the task of attaining spatial
resolution enhancement from the acquired low-resolution degraded
images that comprise the set of observations. With the objective
of improving the performance of the signal processing algorithms
in the presence of the ubiquitous perturbation errors of displacements
around the ideal subpixel locations (because of imperfections in
fabrication), in addition to noisy observation, the errors-in-variables
or the total least-squares method is used in this paper. A regularized
constrained total least-squares (RCTLS) solution to the problem is
given, which requires the minimization cf a nonconvex and nonlinear
cost functional. Simulations indicate that the choice of the regularization
parameter influences significantly the quality of the solution. The
L-curve method is used to select the theoretically optimum value
of the regularization parameter instead of the unsound but expedient
trial-and-error approach. The expected superiority of this RCTLS
approach over the conventional least-squares theory-based algorithm
is substantiated by example. 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int.

@article{Kaipio2000,
abstract = {This paper discusses the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) problem:
electric currents are injected into a body with unknown electromagnetic
properties through a set of contact electrodes. The corresponding
voltages that are needed to maintain these currents are measured.
The objective is to estimate the unknown resistivity, or more generally
the impedivity distribution of the body based on this information.
The most commonly used method to tackle this problem in practice
is to use gradient-based local linearizations. We give a proof for
the differentiability of the electrode boundary data with respect
to the resistivity distribution and the contact impedances. Due to
the ill-posedness of the problem, regularization has to be employed.
In this paper, we consider the EIT problem in the framework of Bayesian
statistics, where the inverse problem is recast into a form of statistical
inference. The problem is to estimate the posterior distribution
of the unknown parameters conditioned on measurement data. From the
posterior density, various estimates for the resistivity distribution
can be calculated as well as a posteriori uncertainties. The search
of the maximum a posteriori estimate is typically an optimization
problem, while the conditional expectation is computed by integrating
the variable with respect to the posterior probability distribution.
In practice, especially when the dimension of the parameter space
is large, this integration must be done by Monte Carlo methods such
as the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. These methods
can also be used for calculation of a posteriori uncertainties for
the estimators. In this paper, we concentrate on MCMC integration
methods. In particular, we demonstrate by numerical examples the
statistical approach when the prior densities are nondifferentiable,
such as the prior penalizing the total variation or the L<sup>1</sup>
norm of the resistivity .},

abstract = {We study the covariance structure of a Markov chain generated by the
Gibbs sampler, with emphasis on data augmentation. When applied to
a Bayesian missing data problem, the Gibbs sampler produces two natural
approximations for the posterior distribution of the parameter vector:
the empirical distribution based on the sampled values of the parameter
vector, and a mixture of complete data posteriors. We prove that
Rao-Blackwellization causes a one-lag delay for the autocovariances
among dependent samples obtained from data augmentation, and consequently,
the mixture approximation produces estimates with smaller variances
than the empirical approximation. The covariance structure results
are used to compare different augmentation schemes. It is shown that
collapsing and grouping random components in a Gibbs sampler with
two or three components usually result in more efficient sampling
schemes.

improved compensation for off-resonance effects. However,

straightforward implementations of such iterative methods suffer

from inconveniently long computation times. This paper describes

a tool for accelerating iterative reconstruction of field-corrected

MR images: a novel time-segmented approximation to the MR

signal equation. We use a minmax formulation to derive the

temporal interpolator. Speedups of around 60 were achieved by

combining this temporal interpolator with a nonuniform fast

abstract = {While conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has long been used to study multiple sclerosis (MS), more sensitive and specific approaches to studying both MS lesions and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) are needed to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. Two MRI techniques thought to offer insight regarding myelin and axonal integrity are T2 relaxation and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this study, metrics obtained from T2 relaxation (specifically myelin water content (MWC) and long-T2 fraction) and DTI experiments (in particular the fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity <D>, parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity) were compared for 19 MS patients within both lesion and contralateral NAWM with the goal of better understanding how each of the measures are affected by pathology. In particular, it was successfully determined that the detection of a long-T2 signal within an MS lesion is indicative of a different underlying pathology than is present in lesions without long-T2 signal. All of the diffusion metrics were significantly different in lesions with a long-T2 signal than in those without. While no significant correlations were found between MWC and <D>, NAWM (R2 = 0.02-0.04, p > 0.07), and only weak correlations were found in lesions without long-T2 signal (R2 = 0.05-0.14, p < 0.04), strong correlations were observed in lesions exhibiting long-T2 signal (R2 = 0.54-0.61, p < 0.0001).},

differences between these two methods are discussed. For both schemes
a detailed study is made of the reconstruction method and its stability

construct the duals of the encoding functions, which are the transverse
excitation profiles generated by radio-frequency pulses along a linear
magnetic field gradient. An analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio

restrict the range of MRI applications, increase the cost of scanning
by limiting throughput, and lead to image artifacts from patient
motion during scans. Ultrafast imaging, in several guises, is now
poised for introduction into clinical practice. With the Instascan
method, a descendant of the echo-planar technique, complete MR images
may be obtained hundreds to thousands of times faster than in conventional
approaches and now yield spatial resolution and contrast directly
comparable to standard MRI. Single-shot imaging methods, such as
Instascan, are utilized in the study of dynamic processes, in the
direct evaluation of motion (as in diffusion sensitive imaging),
and in dramatic new applications, including the interactive control
of intraparenchymal laser surgery. Improvements to the small flip-angle
method, FLASH, have also pushed scan times into the subsecond domain;
this method may be implemented on presently available imaging equipment
but yields contrast behavior different from the traditional spin-echo
techniques and displays signal-to-noise ratios significantly lower
than single-shot imaging. Ultimately, incorporating ultra-fast MR
imaging techniques into the armamentarium of the radiologist will
likely require changes to many aspects of the MRI practice, from
expanded involvement with the scan process to management of the increased

@article{Borgia1998,
abstract = {NMR relaxation data and those from many other physical measurements are sums of exponentially decaying components, combined with some unavoidable measurement noise. When decay data are inverted in order to give quasi-continuous distributions of relaxation times, some smoothing of the distributions is normally implemented to avoid excess variation. When the same distribution has a sharp peak and a much broader peak or a "tail," as for many porous media saturated with liquids, an inversion program using a fixed smoothing coefficient may broaden the sharp peak and/or break the wide peak or tail into several separate peaks, even if the coefficient is adaptively chosen in accord with the noise level of the data. We deal with this problem by using variable smoothing, determined by iterative feedback in such a way that the smoothing penalty is roughly constant. This uniform-penalty (UP) smoothing can give sharp lines, not broadened more than is consistent with the noise, and in the same distribution it can show a tail decades long without breaking it up into several peaks. The noise level must be known approximately, but it can be determined more than adequately by a preliminary inversion. The same iterative procedure is used to implement constraints such as non-negative (NN) or monotonic-from-peak (MT). The significance of an additional resolved peak may be tested by finding the cost of using MT to force a unimodal solution. A bimodal constraint can be applied. Decay data representing sharp lines in contact with broad features can require substantial computing time and some controls to stabilize the iterative sequence. However, UP can be made to function smoothly for a very wide variety of decay curves, which can be processed without adjustment of parameters, including the dimensionless smoothing parameters. Extensive testing has been done with artificial data. Examples are shown for artificial data, biological tissues, ceramic technology, and sandstones. Expressions are given relating noise level to line width and for significance of increase or decrease in error of fit.},

in medical imaging applications. Many imaging modalities exist. Some
provide anatomical information and reveal information about the structure
of the human body, and others provide functional information, locations
of activity for specific activities and specified tasks. Each imaging
system has a characteristic resolution, which is determined based
on physical constraints of the system detectors that are in turn
tuned to signal-to-noise and timing considerations. A common goal
across systems is to increase the resolution, and as much as possible
achieve true isotropic 3-D imaging. SR technology can serve to advance
this goal. Research on SR in key medical imaging modalities, including
MRI, fMRI and PET, has started to emerge in recent years and is reviewed
herein. The algorithms used are mostly based on standard SR algorithms.

@article{Tom2001,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm for enhancing the
resolution of monochrome and color image sequences. Various approaches
toward motion estimation are investigated and compared. Improving
the spatial resolution of an image sequence critically depends upon
the accuracy of the motion estimator. The problem is complicated
by the fact that the motion field is prone to significant errors
since the original high-resolution images are not available. Improved
motion estimates may be obtained by using a more robust and accurate
motion estimator, such as a pel-recursive scheme instead of block
matching. In processing color image sequences, there is the added
advantage of having more flexibility in how the final motion estimates
are obtained, and further improvement in the accuracy of the motion
field is therefore possible. This is because there are three different
intensity fields (channels) conveying the same motion information.
In this paper, the choice of which motion estimator to use versus
how the final estimates are obtained is weighed to see which issue
is more critical in improving the estimated high-resolution sequences.
Toward this end, an iterative algorithm is proposed, and two sets
of experiments are presented. First, several different experiments
using the same motion estimator but three different data fusion approaches
to merge the individual motion fields were performed. Second, estimated
high-resolution images using the block matching estimator were compared
to those obtained by employing a pel recursive scheme. Experiments
were performed on a real color image sequence, and performance was
measured by the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).},

abstract = {T 1relaxation is traditionally described as a mono-exponential signal
decay with spin-lock time. However, T 1quantification by fitting
to the mono-exponential model can be substantially compromised in
the presence of field inhomogeneities, especially for low spin-lock
frequencies. The normal approach to address this issue involves the
development of dedicated composite spin-lock pulses for artifact
reduction while still using the mono-exponential model for T 1fitting.
In this work, we propose an alternative approach for improved T 1quantification
with the widely-used rotary echo spin-lock pulses in the presence
of B 0inhomogeneities by fitting to a modified theoretical model
which is derived to reveal the dependence of T 1 -prepared magnetization
on T 1 , T 2 , spin-lock time, spin-lock frequency and off-resonance,
without involving complicated spin-lock pulse design. It has potentials
for T 1quantification improvement at low spin-lock frequencies.
Improved T 1mapping was demonstrated on phantom and in vivo rat
spin-lock imaging at 3 T compared to the mapping using the mono-exponential

For this task, a stand-alone magnetometer system based on multiple (2)H transmit-receive NMR probes has been developed. The conceptual advantages of changing to (2)H NMR probes for (1)H magnetic field monitoring are elucidated here, and the practical design of the probes is described. In comparison to previous (1)H NMR probe-based designs, (2)H probes are perfectly decoupled from standard (1)H imaging. Utilization of RF shielding or other nonoptimal decoupling schemes is therefore not needed. Probes based on (2)H nuclei are also more easily miniaturized for high-resolution imaging. This is particularly important for diffusion tensor and phase-contrast imaging, which rely on strong motion-sensitizing gradients. The presented (2)H NMR probes have been shown to fulfill the requirements for accurate (1)H imaging down to image resolutions of 0.2 mm. Using susceptibility matching techniques, the probe's B(0) inhomogeneity-induced signal dephasing is reduced and monitoring periods beyond 200 msec are achieved.

abstract = {Conventional MR images are qualitative, and their signal intensity is dependent on several complementary contrast mechanisms that are manipulated by the MR hardware and software. In the absence of a quantitative metric for absolute interpretation of pixel signal intensities, one that is independent of scanner hardware and sequences, it is difficult to perform comparisons of MR images across subjects or longitudinally in the same subject. Quantitative relaxometry isolates the contributions of individual MR contrast mechanisms (T1, T2, T2*) and provides maps, which are independent of the MR protocol and have a physical interpretation often expressed in absolute units. In addition to providing an unbiased metric for comparing MR scans, quantitative relaxometry uses the relationship between MR maps and physiology to provide a noninvasive surrogate for biopsy and histology.

This point minimizes the sum of the squares of the Euclidean distances
to the hyperplanes of the system. If the starting point is chosen
properly, then the limits approach the minimum norm weighted least

abstract = {Relaxation time measurements at 3.0 T are reported for both gray and white matter in normal human brain. Measurements were made using a 3.0 T Bruker Biospec magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in normal adults with no clinical evidence of neurological disease. Nineteen subjects, 8 female and 11 male, were studied for T1 and T2 measurements, and 7 males were studied for T*2. Measurements were made using a saturation recovery method for T1, a multiple spin-echo experiment for T2, and a fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence with 14 different echo times for T*2. Results of the measurements are summarized as follows. Average T1 values measured for gray matter and white matter were 1331 and 832 msec, respectively. Average T2 values measured for gray matter and white matter were 80 and 110 msec, respectively. The average T*2 values for occipital and frontal gray matter were 41.6 and 51.8 msec, respectively. Average T*2 values for occipital and frontal white matter were 48.4 and 44.7 msec, respectively. ANOVA tests of the measurements revealed that for both gray and white matter there were no significant differences in T1 from one location in the brain to another. T2 in occipital gray matter was significantly higher (0.0001<P<.0375) than the rest of the gray matter, while T2 in frontal white matter was significantly lower (P<0.0001). Statistical analysis of cerebral hemispheric differences in relaxation time measurements showed no significant differences in T1 values from the left hemisphere compared with the right, except in insular gray matter, where this difference was significant at P = 0.0320. No significant difference in T2 values existed between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Significant differences were apparent between male and female relaxation time measurements in brain. J.

abstract = {Abstract The myelin sheath, which is wrapped around the axons in the
brain, can be affected by many diseases, resulting in cognitive and
physical disability. Other work showed water in the myelin sheath
has a T2 15 ms. The current standard technique to estimate the
fraction of myelin water in vivo is to collect multiecho data and
fit the decay curves using a nonnegative least-squares (NNLS) algorithm.
A new algorithm was developed to calculate optimized coefficients
which were used to linearly combine multiecho data to estimate the
myelin water signal. A set of simulations showed the new technique
was accurate over a broad range of myelin water signal. The myelin
water fraction from brain regions in scans from five volunteers,
estimated by the linear combination method, agreed with the myelin
water fraction estimated by the standard technique. The strength
of the new technique is that the linear combination does not assume
an underlying T2 model and is 20,000 times faster than NNLS. Magn

abstract = {Magnetic field monitoring with NMR probes has recently been introduced
as a means of measuring the actual spatiotemporal magnetic field
evolution during individual MR scans. Receive-only NMR probes as
used thus far for this purpose impose significant practical limitations
due to radiofrequency (RF) interference with the actual MR experiment.
In this work these limitations are overcome with a transmit/receive
(T/R) monitoring system based on RF-shielded NMR probes. The proposed
system is largely autonomous and protected against RF contamination.
As a consequence the field probes can be positioned freely and permit
monitoring imaging procedures of arbitrary geometry and angulation.
The T/R approach is also exploited to simplify probe manufacturing
and remove constraints on material choices. Probe miniaturization
permits monitoring imaging scans with nominal resolutions on the
order of 400 m. The added capabilities of the new probes and system
are demonstrated by first in vivo results, obtained with monitored
gradient-echo and spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) scans. Magn

abstract = {The presented paper describes a magnetic field sensor system for the
real-time monitoring of magnetic resonance (MR) image encoding in
the presence of gradient and main magnetic field imperfections. For
this purpose, a novel simplified design for nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) probes has been developed. The design fulfills the requirements
of providing below ppm measurement accuracy in combination with long
readout times. To this end, NMR is performed with a nanoliter water
volume, which together with the radiofrequency (RF) solenoid coil
is cast into an Epoxy holder. Based on the Larmor relation (i.e.
the proportionality between the NMR resonance frequency and the local
B0), time varying magnetic field information is extracted from the
phase evolution of the detected RF signals. Susceptibility matching
techniques are applied to homogenize the B0 field across the NMR
sample and in this way to extend the readout time of the NMR probes.
The presented design of NMR probe is significantly simpler compared
to previous presented ones by De Zanche et al. in the sense that
it omits the glass capillary plus additional matching fluidics. The
optimization of the susceptibility for the Epoxy is described and
results of the probe characterization measurements are presented.
The feasibility of magnetic field monitored MRI is demonstrated for
ultra-fast single- and multishot data acquisition schemes.},

abstract = {This work describes an interleaved echo planar imaging (EPI) method
for use on a standard whole body scanner. The data acquisition is
divided into two to eight repetitions rather than one to two, as
implemented by dedicated EPI systems. Interleaving allows the use
of a lower sampling bandwidth with a significant increase in signal-to-noise.
The method also has the advantages of relative ease of implementation,
no need for postprocessing to remove image distortion, and no need
for shimming on a case-by-case basis. The interleaved EPI method
was applied to two applications ideally suited to EPI: breathhold
T2-weighted abdominal imaging and functional imaging. In vivo liver-lesion

abstract = {Abstract A basic framework for image reconstruction from spatial encoding by curvilinear, nonbijective magnetic encoding fields in combination with multiple receivers is presented. The theory was developed in the context of the recently introduced parallel imaging technique using localized gradients (PatLoc) approach. In this new imaging modality, the linear gradient fields are generalized to arbitrarily shaped, nonbijective spatial encoding magnetic fields, which lead to ambiguous encoding. Ambiguities are resolved by adaptation of concepts developed for parallel imaging. Based on theoretical considerations, a practical algorithm for Cartesian trajectories is derived in the case that the conventional gradient coils are replaced by coils for PatLoc. The reconstruction method extends Cartesian sensitivity encoding (SENSE) reconstruction with an additional voxelwise intensity-correction step. Spatially varying resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and truncation artifacts are described and analyzed. Theoretical considerations are validated by two-dimensional simulations based on multipolar encoding fields and they are confirmed by applying the reconstruction algorithm to initial experimental data.},

abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/mrm.1910380117.abs In interleaved spiral MRI, an
object's Fourier transform is sampled along a set of curved trajectories
in the spatial frequency domain (k-space). An image of the object
is then reconstructed, usually by interpolating the sampled Fourier
data onto a Cartesian grid and applying the fast Fourier transform
(FFT) algorithm. To obtain accurate results, it is necessary to account
for the nonuniform density with which k-space is sampled. An analytic
density compensation function (DCF) for spiral MRI, based on the
Jacobian determinant for the transformation between Cartesian coordinates
and the spiral sampling parameters of time and interleaf rotation
angle, is derived in this paper, and the reconstruction accuracy
achieved using this function is compared with that obtained using
several previously published expressions. Various non-ideal conditions,
including intersecting trajectories, are considered. The new DCF
eliminated intensity cupping that was encountered in images reconstructed
with other functions, and significantly reduced the level of artifact
observed when unevenly spaced sampling trajectories, such as those
achieved with trapezoidal gradient waveforms, were employed. Modified
forms of this function were found to provide similar improvements
when intersecting trajectories made the spiral-Cartesian transformation
noninvertible, and when the shape of the spiral trajectory varied
between interleaves.},

model to measure myelin, myelinated-axon, and mixed water-pool fractions

at 1.9 Tesla, and conventional spin-echo imaging were used to acquire
T1 and T2 relaxation data in 15 normal children ranging in age from
3 months to 13 years 4 months. Three equations with three unknowns
were solved to calculate three water-pool fractions for each child
in a frontal association-fiber area and a frontal-parietal projection-fiber
area. The temporal trend of the fractions was compared with a theoretical
three-pool myelination model.ResultsThe myelin level in the projection-fiber
area rose earlier than in the association-fiber area following the
standard caudal-to-rostral trend. The temporal trend of the three-pool
fractions followed that predicted by the theoretical myelination
model in both brain areas. The myelinated-axon and mixed pool sizes
were significantly different in the two WM areas following early
myelination, although their myelin pools were similar. T1 values
correlated more highly with the myelinated-axon and mixed pool fractions
than with the myelin pool fraction.ConclusionThe three-pool relaxation
model provides measurements of water-pool fractions in WM that follow
values predicted during myelination. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2003;17:110.

AD according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, 43 subjects fulfilling
the NIMH criteria of age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), 42
cognitively normal elderly controls, and 20 controls younger than

were atrophied in the AD patients, but not in the AAMI subjects or
the elderly controls. There was no significant correlation between
hippocampal volumes and age in the nondemented subjects. The discrimination
based on volumetry resulted in an overall correct classification
of 92\% of AD patients vs. nondemented elderly subjects, whereas discrimination
based on hippocampal area was less accurate, producing a correct
classification in 80\% of the subjects. We conclude that the hippocampus
as assessed by MRI volumetry is atrophied early in AD, and spared
by aging or AAMI. A brief critical review of previous studies is
in concordance with the presented data: all the previous studies
that have used volumetry, have similarly ended up with a good classification,

developed. Phase encoding produces optimum SNR, but it has relatively
short effective repetition times. Line scanning has poor SNR but
has long effective repetition times. Wavelet encoding is generalized
to use wavelet packet bases. Wavelet packet bases include a wide
class of bases. They include the bases used for Hadamard and phase
encoding at one extreme and line scanning at the other. If the appropriate
basis is chosen from among the wavelet packet bases, SNR can be freely
traded for longer effective repetition times. Several other results

abstract = {Zero echo time can be obtained in MRI by performing radiofrequency (RF) excitation as well as acquisition in the presence of a constant gradient applied for purely frequency-encoded, radial centre-out k-space encoding. In this approach, the spatially nonselective excitation must uniformly cover the full frequency bandwidth spanned by the readout gradient. This can be accomplished either by short, hard RF pulses or by pulses with a frequency sweep as used in the SWIFT (Sweep imaging with Fourier transform) method for improved performance at limited RF amplitudes. In this work, the two options are compared with respect to T2 sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and SNR efficiency. In particular, the SNR implications of sweep excitation and of initial or periodical acquisition gaps required for transmit-receive switching are investigated. It was found by simulations and experiments that, whereas equivalent in terms of T2 sensitivity, the two techniques differ in SNR performance. With ideal, ungapped simultaneous excitation and acquisition, the sweep approach would yield higher SNR throughout due to larger feasible flip angles. However, acquisition gapping is found to take a significant SNR toll related to a reduced acquisition duty cycle, rendering hard pulse excitation superior for sufficient RF amplitude and also in the short-T2 limit.

The dominant observed factors affecting T1 are tissue type and NMR frequency (nu). All tissue frequency dispersions can be fitted to the simple expression T1=AnuB in the range 1100 MHz, with A and B tissue-dependent constants. This equation provides as good or better fit to the data as previous more complex formulas. T2 is found to be multicomponent, essentially independent of NMR frequency, and dependent mainly on tissue type. Mean and raw values of T1 and T2 for each tissue are tabulated and/or plotted versus frequency and the fitting parameters A, B and the standard deviations determined to establish the normal range of relaxation times applicable to NMR imaging. The mechanisms for tissue NMR relaxation are reviewed with reference to the fast exchange two state (FETS) model of water in biological systems, and an overview of the dynamic state of water and macromolecular hydrogen compatible with the frequency, temperature, and multicomponent data is postulated. This suggests that 1H tissue T1 is determined predominantly by intermolecular (possibly rotational) interactions between macromolecules and a single bound hydration layer, and the T2 is governed mainly by exchange diffusion of water between the bound layer and a free water phase. Deficiencies in measurement techniques are identified as major sources of data irreproducibility.},

abstract = {Of all available reconstruction methods, statistical iterative reconstruction
algorithms appear particularly promising since they enable accurate
physical noise modeling. The newly developed compressive sampling/compressed
sensing (CS) algorithm has shown the potential to accurately reconstruct
images from highly undersampled data. The CS algorithm can be implemented
in the statistical reconstruction framework as well. In this study,
we compared the performance of two standard statistical reconstruction
algorithms (penalized weighted least squares and q-GGMRF) to the
CS algorithm. In assessing the image quality using these iterative
reconstructions, it is critical to utilize realistic background anatomy
as the reconstruction results are object dependent. A cadaver head
was scanned on a Varian Trilogy system at different dose levels.
Several figures of merit including the relative root mean square
error and a quality factor which accounts for the noise performance
and the spatial resolution were introduced to objectively evaluate
reconstruction performance. A comparison is presented between the
three algorithms for a constant undersampling factor comparing different
algorithms at several dose levels. To facilitate this comparison,
the original CS method was formulated in the framework of the statistical
image reconstruction algorithms. Important conclusions of the measurements
from our studies are that (1) for realistic neuro-anatomy, over 100
projections are required to avoid streak artifacts in the reconstructed
images even with CS reconstruction, (2) regardless of the algorithm
employed, it is beneficial to distribute the total dose to more views
as long as each view remains quantum noise limited and (3) the total
variation-based CS method is not appropriate for very low dose levels
because while it can mitigate streaking artifacts, the images exhibit
patchy behavior, which is potentially harmful for medical diagnosis.},

abstract = {An implicit exact algebraic solution of CPMG experiments is presented
and applied to fit experiments. Approximate solutions are also employed
to explore oscillations and effective decay rates of CPMG experiments.
The simplest algebraic approximate solution has illustrated that
measured intensities will oscillate in the conventional CPMG experiments
and that using even echoes can suppress errors of measurements of
R2 due to the imperfection of high-power pulses. To deal with low-power
pulses with finite width, we adapt the effective field to calculate
oscillations. An optimization model with the effective field approximation
and dimensionless variables is proposed to quantify oscillations
of measured intensities of CPMG experiments of different phases of
the pulses. We show, as was known using other methods, that repeating
one group of four pulses with different phases in CPMG experiments,
which we call phase variation, but others call phase alternation
or phase cycling, can significantly smooth the dependence of measured
intensities on frequency offset in the range of 1 2 B 1 . In
this paper, a second-order expression with respect to the ratio of
frequency offset to -pulse amplitude is developed to describe the
effective R2 of CPMG experiments when using a group phase variation
scheme. Experiments demonstrate that (1) the exact calculation of
CPMG experiments can remarkably eliminate systematic errors in measured
R2s due to the effects of frequency offset, even in the absence of
phase variation; (2) CPMG experiments with group phase variation
can substantially remove oscillations and effects of the field inhomogeneity;
(3) the second-order expression of the effective decay rate with
phase variation is able to provide reliable estimates of R2 when
offsets are roughly within 1 2 B 1 ; and, most significantly,
(4) the more sophisticated optimization model using an exact solution
of the discretized CPMG experiment extends, to B1, the range
of offsets for which reliable estimates of R2 can be obtained when
using the preferred phase variation scheme.},

abstract = {Numerous methods have been developed to measure MRI gradient waveforms
and k-space trajectories. The most promising new strategy appears
to be magnetic field monitoring with RF microprobes. Multiple RF
microprobes may record the magnetic field evolution associated with
a wide variety of imaging pulse sequences. The method involves exciting
one or more test samples and measuring the time evolution of magnetization
through the FIDs. Two critical problems remain. The gradient waveform
duration is limited by the sample T(2)*, while the k-space maxima
are limited by gradient dephasing. The method presented is based
on pure phase encode FIDs and solves the above two problems in addition
to permitting high strength gradient measurement. A small doped water
phantom (1-3 mm droplet, T(1), T(2), T(2)* < 100 micros) within a
microprobe is excited by a series of closely spaced broadband RF
pulses each followed by FID single point acquisition. Two trial gradient
waveforms have been chosen to illustrate the technique, neither of
which could be measured by the conventional RF microprobe measurement.
The first is an extended duration gradient waveform while the other
illustrates the new method's ability to measure gradient waveforms
with large net area and/or high amplitude. The new method is a point

maps can be obtained in vivo with either gradient echo (GE) or spin

The application of the SE approach for correcting intensity nonuniformities

shown that this in vivo B1+ and reception sensitivity mapping can
be performed using segmented echo planar imaging sequences providing

To better fulfill this need, a new approach is presented that enables
measuring the field evolution concurrently with any MR sequence.
Miniature NMR probes are used to monitor the MR phase evolution around
the object under investigation. Based on these data, a global phase
model is calculated that can then be used as a basis for processing
the actual image or spectroscopic data. The new method is demonstrated
by MRI of a phantom, using spin-warp, spiral, and EPI trajectories.
Throughout, the monitoring results enabled highly accurate image
reconstruction, even in the presence of massive gradient imperfections.

can substantially improve our understanding of white matter diseases
such as multiple sclerosis In this study, in vivo myelin water content
was estimated using T-2\{*\} relaxation with multi-slice acquisitions
in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) The main advantages of using
T-2\{*\} relaxation are (1) a low specific absorption rate (SAR), which
is especially beneficial for imaging at high field strengths, (2)
a short first-echo time (similar to 2 ms) and short echo spacing
(similar to 1 ms). which allows for the acquisition of multiple sampling
points during the fast decay of the myelin water signal, and (3)
fast multi-slice acquisitions High-resolution and multi-slice myelin
water fraction (MWF) maps were obtained in a clinically acceptable
scan time at 31 Five healthy adults were scanned with a multi-gradient-echo
sequence to acquire T-2\{*\} signal decay data Images with a dimension
of 256 x 256 at eight slice locations were acquired in 8 5 min with
a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 948 in the first-echo images. The
SNR was further increased by using an anisotropic diffusion filter.
Local field gradients (LFG) were estimated from the acquired multi-slice
data, and the LFG-induced signal decays were corrected with a first-order
approximation of LFG using the sine function The corrected T-2\{*\}
signal decays were analyzed with a three-pool model to quantify MWF
Our results demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo multi-slice mapping
of MWF using multi-compartmental analysis of the T-2\{*\} signal decay

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to elucidate inherent limitations to
the performance of parallel MRI. The study focuses on the ultimate
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which refers to the maximum SNR permitted
by the electrodynamics of the signal detection process. Using a spherical
model object, it is shown that the behavior of the ultimate SNR imposes
distinct limits on the acceleration rate in parallel imaging. For
low and moderate acceleration, the ultimate SNR performance is nearly
optimal, with geometry factors close to 1. However, for high reduction
factors beyond a critical value, the ultimate performance deteriorates
rapidly, corresponding to exponential growth of the geometry factor.
The transition from optimal to deteriorating performance depends
on the electrodynamic characteristics of the detected RF fields.
In the near-field regime, i.e., for low B-o and small object size,
the critical reduction factor is constant and approximately equal
to four for 1D acceleration in the sphere. In the far-field wave
regime the critical reduction factor is larger and increases both
with B-o and object size. Therefore, it is concluded that parallel
techniques hold particular promise for human MR imaging at very high
field.},

Subpixel enhancement of nonuniform tissue (SPENT) is a novel MRI technique that can provide (direction specific) information based on the subvoxel structural uniformity of a sample. We hypothesized that the SPENT signal would be related to BMD. This hypothesis was tested using (1) 2D computer simulation of a simplified bone structure and (2) in vitro experiments. Simulation results suggested that a resolution of 610–800 $\mu$m was required for SPENT to be correlated well with the simulated bone volume fraction (BVF) and, at this resolution, a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR > 5) was required for reasonable data quality. For the experiments, 15-mm3 human trabecular bone samples were used (1) to quantify BMD (through both physical measurement and DXA) and (2) to perform MRI on a 7T system. Standard and SPENT images were obtained. Normalized SPENT (NSPENT) images were calculated by pixel-by-pixel division of the SPENT images by the standard proton density images to remove any dependence on proton density and coil uniformity from the SPENT images. The average NSPENT values were determined over the sample volume and compared with the reference BMD measurements. Each of the individual NSPENT directions was highly correlated with BMD (x-NSPENT, R2 = 0.73, p < 0.001; y-NSPENT, R2 = 0.76, p < 0.001; z-NSPENT, R2 = 0.89, p < 0.001). With all three individual NSPENT directions combined, the correlation with BMD was found to be the highest (xyz-NSPENT, R2 = 0.95, p < 0.001). The results suggest that the SPENT technique can provide a noninvasive measure of BMD at resolution and SNR levels achievable in vivo.},

abstract = {Abstract The recently introduced planar strip array (PSA) can significantly
reduce scan times in parallel MRI by enabling the utilization of
a large number of RF strip detectors that are inherently decoupled,
and are tuned by adjusting the strip length to integer multiples
of a quarter-wavelength (/4) in the presence of a ground plane
and dielectric substrate. In addition, the more explicit spatial
information embedded in the phase of the signals from the strip array
is advantageous (compared to loop arrays) for limiting aliasing artifacts
in parallel MRI. However, losses in the detector as its natural resonance
frequency approaches the Larmor frequency (where the wavelength is
long at 1.5 T) may limit the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the PSA.
Moreover, the PSA's inherent /4 structure severely limits our ability
to adjust detector geometry to optimize the performance for a specific
organ system, as is done with loop coils. In this study we replaced
the dielectric substrate with discrete capacitors, which resulted
in both SNR improvement and a tunable lumped-element PSA (LPSA) whose
dimensions can be optimized within broad constraints, for a given
region of interest (ROI) and MRI frequency. A detailed theoretical
analysis of the LPSA is presented, including its equivalent circuit,
electromagnetic fields, SNR, and g-factor maps for parallel MRI.
Two different decoupling schemes for the LPSA are described. A four-element
LPSA prototype was built to test the theory with quantitative measurements
on images obtained with parallel and conventional acquisition schemes.

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the most versatile experimental
methods in chemistry, physics and biology, providing insight into
the structure and dynamics of matter at the molecular scale. Its
imaging variant - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - is widely used
to examine the anatomy, physiology and metabolism of the human body.
NMR signal detection is traditionally based on Faraday induction
in one or multiple radio-frequency resonators that are brought into
close proximity with the sample. Alternative principles involving
structured-material flux guides, superconducting quantum interference
devices, atomic magnetometers, Hall probes or magnetoresistive elements
have been explored. However, a common feature of all NMR implementations
until now is that they rely on close coupling between the detector
and the object under investigation. Here we show that NMR can also
be excited and detected by long-range interaction, relying on travelling
radio-frequency waves sent and received by an antenna. One benefit
of this approach is more uniform coverage of samples that are larger
than the wavelength of the NMR signal - an important current issue
in MRI of humans at very high magnetic fields. By allowing a significant
distance between the probe and the sample, travelling-wave interaction
also introduces new possibilities in the design of NMR experiments

@article{Lin2006,
abstract = {MRI is widely used for noninvasive hemodynamic-based functional brain
imaging. In traditional spatial encoding, however, gradient switching
limits the temporal resolution, which makes it difficult to unambiguously
identify possible fast nonhemodynamic changes. In this paper we propose
a novel reconstruction approach, called dynamic inverse imaging (InI),
that is capable of providing millisecond temporal resolution when
highly parallel detection is used. To achieve an order-of-magnitude
speedup in generating time-resolved contrast estimates and dynamic
statistical parametric maps (dSPMs), the spatial information is derived
from an array of detectors rather than by time-consuming gradient-encoding
methods. The InI approach was inspired by electroencephalography
(EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) source localization techniques.
Dynamic MR InI was evaluated by means of numerical simulations. InI
was also applied to measure BOLD hemodynamic time curves at 20-ms
temporal resolution in a visual stimulation experiment using a 90-channel
head array. InI is expected to improve the time resolution of MRI
and provide increased flexibility in the trade-off between spatial
and temporal resolution for studies of dynamic activation patterns
in the human brain. 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Vinitski1990,
abstract = {Conventional spin-echo images are susceptible to motion induced artifact,
which is exacerbated by lipid signals. Gradient moment nulling can
reduce motion artifact but lengthens the minimum TE, degrading the
contrast. We designed a pulse sequence capable of optimizing proton
density and T2-weighted contrast while suppressing lipid signals
and motion induced artifacts. Proton density weighting was obtained
by rapid readout gradient reversal immediately after the excitation
RF pulse, within a conventional spin-echo sequence. By analyzing
the behavior of the macroscopic magnetization and optimizing excitation
flip angle, we suppressed T1 contribution to the image, thereby enhancing
proton density and T2-weighted contrast with a two- to four-fold
reduction of repetition time. This permitted an increased number
of averages to be used, reducing motion induced artifacts.

Fat suppression in the presence of motion was investigated in two
groups of 8 volunteers each by (i) modified Dixon technique, (ii)
selective excitation, and (iii) hybrid of both. Elimination of fat
signal by the first technique was relatively uniform across the field
of view, but it did not fully suppress the ghosts originating from
fat motion. Selective excitation, while sensitive to the main field
inhomogeneity, largely eliminated the ghosts The hybrid of both techniques
combined with bandwidth optimization, however, showed the best results

Variable flip-angle imaging allows optimization of image contrast
which, along with averaging and effective fat suppression, significantly
improves gradient- and spin-echo imaging, particularly in the presence
of motion.},

sought to shed light on these processes with MRI, particularly in
vivo. In this work, a new hybrid technique based on EPI and using

k-space data between images and acquiring the keyhole more frequently,
it is shown that the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images
can be maintained. The method affords a higher temporal resolution
and is more robust against susceptibility and chemical-shift artifacts
than single-shot EPI. The method, termed shared k-space echo planar
imaging with keyhole (shared EPIK), has been implemented on a standard
clinical scanner. Technical details, simulation results, phantom
images, in vivo images, and fMRI results are presented. These results
indicate that the new method is robust and may be used for dynamic

@article{Hardie2007,
abstract = {A computationally simple super-resolution algorithm using a type of
adaptive Wiener filter is proposed. The algorithm produces an improved
resolution image from a sequence of low-resolution (LR) video frames
with overlapping field of view. The algorithm uses subpixel registration
to position each LR pixel value on a common spatial grid that is
referenced to the average position of the input frames. The positions
of the LR pixels are not quantized to a finite grid as with some
previous techniques. The output high-resolution (HR) pixels are obtained
using a weighted sum of LR pixels in a local moving window. Using
a statistical model, the weights for each HR pixel are designed to
minimize the mean squared error and they depend on the relative positions
of the surrounding LR pixels. Thus, these weights adapt spatially
and temporally to changing distributions of LR pixels due to varying
motion. Both a global and spatially varying statistical model are
considered here. Since the weights adapt with distribution of LR
pixels, it is quite robust and will not become unstable when an unfavorable
distribution of LR pixels is observed. For translational motion,
the algorithm has a low computational complexity and may be readily
suitable for real-time and/or near real-time processing applications.
With other motion models, the computational complexity goes up significantly.
However, regardless of the motion model, the algorithm lends itself
to parallel implementation. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm
is demonstrated here in a number of experimental results using simulated
and real video sequences. A computational analysis is also presented.

abstract = {New, efficient reconstruction procedures are proposed for sensitivity
encoding (SENSE) with arbitrary k-space trajectories. The presented
methods combine gridding principles with so-called conjugate-gradient
iteration. In this fashion, the bulk of the work of reconstruction
can be performed by fast Fourier transform (FFT), reducing the complexity
of data processing to the same order of magnitude as in conventional
gridding reconstruction. Using the proposed method, SENSE becomes
practical with non-standard k-space trajectories, enabling considerable
scan time reduction with respect to mere gradient encoding. This
is illustrated by imaging simulations with spiral, radial, and random
k-space patterns. Simulations were also used for investigating the
convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm and its dependence
on the factor by which gradient encoding is reduced. The in vivo
feasibility of non-Cartesian SENSE imaging with iterative reconstruction
is demonstrated by examples of brain and cardiac imaging using spiral
trajectories. In brain imaging with six receiver coils, the number
of spiral interleaves was reduced by factors ranging from 2 to 6.
In cardiac real-time imaging with four coils, spiral SENSE permitted
reducing the scan time per image from 112 ms to 56 ms, thus doubling
the frame-rate. 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, the maximum a posteriori probability

to propose a unified methodology toward the more complicated problem
of superresolution restoration. In the superresolution restoration
problem, an improved resolution image is restored from several geometrically
warped, blurred, noisy and downsampled measured images. The superresolution
restoration problem is modeled and analyzed from the ML, the MAP,

restoration methods. The proposed restoration approach is general
but assumes explicit knowledge of the linear space- and time-variant
blur, the (additive Gaussian) noise, the different measured resolutions,
and the (smooth) motion characteristics. A hybrid method combining
the simplicity of the ML and the incorporation of nonellipsoid constraints
is presented, giving improved restoration performance, compared with
the ML and the POCS approaches. The hybrid method is shown to converge
to the unique optimal solution of a new definition of the optimization

abstract = {Quantitative, apparent T2 values of suspected prostate cancer and healthy peripheral zone tissue in men with prostate cancer were measured using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) imaging sequence in order to assess the cancer discrimination potential of tissue T2 values. The CPMG imaging sequence was used to image the prostates of 18 men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer. Whole gland coverage with nominal voxel volumes of 0.541.14 mm3 was obtained in 10.7 min, resulting in data sets suitable for generating high-quality images with variable T2-weighting and for evaluating quantitative T2 values on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Region-of-interest analysis of suspected healthy peripheral zone tissue and suspected cancer, identified on the basis of both T1- and T2-weighted signal intensities and available histopathology reports, yielded significantly (P<.0001) longer apparent T2 values in suspected healthy tissue (19349 ms) vs. suspected cancer (10026 ms), suggesting potential utility of this method as a tissue specific discrimination index for prostate cancer. We conclude that CPMG imaging of the prostate can be performed in reasonable scan times and can provide advantages over T2-weighted fast spin echo (FSE) imaging alone, including quantitative T2 values for cancer discrimination as well as proton density maps without the point spread function degradation associated with short effective echo time FSE sequences.},

inaccuracy (10\%13\% longer T2 values) is introduced from stimulated

in measured T2 by up to 48\% with a multiecho sequence. Use of the
multiecho sequence in the multislice mode resulted in T2 values closer
to the single-echo standards for the volunteer studies. However,
this apparent increased accuracy should be regarded as circumstantial,
as it only occurs because the error due to MTC has the opposite sign
compared to the error due to the stimulated echo contribution.ConclusionUse

abstract = {Abstract Spatial encoding in MRI is conventionally achieved by the
application of switchable linear encoding fields. The general concept
of the recently introduced PatLoc (Parallel Imaging Technique using
Localized Gradients) encoding is to use nonlinear fields to achieve
spatial encoding. Relaxing the requirement that the encoding fields
must be linear may lead to improved gradient performance or reduced
peripheral nerve stimulation. In this work, a custom-built insert
coil capable of generating two independent quadratic encoding fields
was driven with high-performance amplifiers within a clinical MR
system. In combination with the three linear encoding fields, the
combined hardware is capable of independently manipulating five spatial
encoding fields. With the linear z-gradient used for slice-selection,
there remain four separate channels to encode a 2D-image. To compare
trajectories of such multidimensional encoding, the concept of a
local k-space is developed. Through simulations, reconstructions
using six gradient-encoding strategies were compared, including Cartesian
encoding separately or simultaneously on both PatLoc and linear gradients
as well as two versions of a radial-based in/out trajectory. Corresponding
experiments confirmed that such multidimensional encoding is practically
achievable and demonstrated that the new radial-based trajectory
offers the PatLoc property of variable spatial resolution while maintaining
finite resolution across the entire field-of-view. Magn Reson Med,

an inverse wavelet transform of the spin density in the region in

of spins which rephase at different times during acquisition. They

abstract = {T2 weighting is particularly sensitive, but notoriously unspecific, to a wide range of brain pathologies. However, careful measurement and analysis of the T2 decay curve from brain tissue promise to provide much improved pathological specificity. In vivo T2 measurement requires accurate 180 pulses and appropriate manipulation of stimulated echoes; the most common approach is to acquire multiple echoes from a single slice. The T2 distribution, a plot of component amplitude as a function of T2, can be estimated using an algorithm capable of fitting a multi-exponential T2 decay with no a priori assumptions about the number of exponential components. T2 distributions from normal brain show peaks from myelin water, intra/extracellular water and cerebral spinal fluid; they can be used to provide estimates of total water content (total area under the T2 distribution) and myelin water fraction (MWF, fractional area under the myelin water peak), a measure believed to be related to myelin content. Experiments on bovine brain suggest that magnetization exchange between water pools plays a minor role in the T2 distribution. Different white matter structures have different MWFs. In normal white matter (NWM), MWF is not correlated with the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) or the diffusion tensor fractional anisotropy (FA); hence it provides unique information about brain microstructure. Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) brain possesses a higher water content and lower MWF than controls, consistent with histopathological findings. Multiple sclerosis lesions demonstrate great heterogeneity in MWF, presumably due to varying myelin contents of these focal regions of pathology. Subjects with schizophrenia were found to have significantly reduced MWF in the minor forceps and genu of the corpus callosum when compared to controls, suggesting that reduced frontal lobe myelination plays a role in schizophrenia. In normal controls, frontal lobe myelination was positively correlated with both age and education; this result was not observed in subjects with schizophrenia. A strong correlation between MWF and the optical density from the luxol fast blue histological stain for myelin was observed in formalin-fixed brain, supporting the use of the MWF as an in vivo myelin marker.},

abstract = {Cramer-Rao bounds on estimation accuracy are established for estimation
problems on arbitrary manifolds in which no set of intrinsic coordinates
exists. The frequently encountered examples of estimating either
an unknown subspace or a covariance matrix are examined in detail.
The set of subspaces, called the Grassmann manifold, and the set
of covariance (positive-definite Hermitian) matrices have no fixed
coordinate system associated with them and do not possess a vector
space structure, both of which are required for deriving classical
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds. Intrinsic versions of the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound
on manifolds utilizing an arbitrary affine connection with arbitrary
geodesics are derived for both biased and unbiased estimators. In
the example of covariance matrix estimation, closed-form expressions
for both the intrinsic and flat bounds are derived and compared with
the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the sample covariance matrix
(SCM) estimator for varying sample support K. The accuracy bound
on unbiased covariance matrix estimators is shown to be about (10/log
10)n/K<sup>1/2</sup> dB, where n is the matrix order. Remarkably,
it is shown that from an intrinsic perspective, the SCM is a biased
and inefficient estimator and that the bias term reveals the dependency
of estimation accuracy on sample support observed in theory and practice.
The RMSE of the standard method of estimating subspaces using the
singular value decomposition (SVD) is compared with the intrinsic
subspace Cramr-Rao bound derived in closed form by varying both
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the unknown p-dimensional subspace
and the sample support. In the simplest case, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao
bound on subspace estimation accuracy is shown to be about (p(n -
p))<sup>1/2</sup>K<sup>-1/2</sup>SNH<sup>-1/2</sup> rad for p-dimensional
subspaces. It is seen that the SVD-based method yields accuracies
very close to the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, establishing that the principal
invariant subspace of a random sample provides an excellent estimator
of an unknown subspace. The analysis approach developed is directly
applicable to many other estimation problems on manifolds encountered
in signal processing and elsewhere, such as estimating rotation matrices
in computer vision and estimating subspace basis vectors in blind
source separation.},

@article{Chaumette2008,
abstract = {AbstractIt is well known that the ML estimator exhibits a

threshold effect, i.e., a rapid deterioration of estimation accuracy

below a certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or number of

snapshots. This effect is caused by outliers and is not captured

by standard tools such as the Cramr-Rao bound (CRB). The

search of the SNR threshold value (where the CRB becomes unreliable

for prediction of maximum likelihood estimator variance)

can be achieved with the help of the Barankin bound (BB), as

proposed by many authors. The major drawback of the BB, in

comparison with the CRB, is the absence of a general analytical

formula, which compels one to resort to a discrete form, usually

the McaulaySeidman bound (MSB), requesting the search of an

optimum over a set of test points. In this paper, we propose a new

practical BB discrete form that provides, for a given set of test

points, an improved SNR threshold prediction in comparison with

existing approximations (MSB, Abel bound, McaulayHofstetter

bound) at the expense of the computational complexity increased

by a factor, where is the number of unknown parameters.

We have derived its expression for the general Gaussian

observation model to be used in place of existing approximations},

abstract = {An image-acquisition system composed of an array of sensors, where
each sensor has a subarray of sensing elements of suitable size,
has recently been popular for increasing the spatial resolution with
high signal-to-noise ratio beyond the performance bound of technologies
that constrain the manufacture of imaging devices. Small perturbations
around the ideal subpixel locations of the sensing elements (responsible
for capturing the sequence of undersampled degraded frames), because
of imperfections in fabrication, limit the performance of the signal-processing
algorithms for processing and integrating the acquired images for
the desired enhanced resolution and quality. The contributions of
this paper include an analysis of the displacement errors on the
convergence rate of the iterative approach for solving the transform
based preconditioned system of equations. Subsequently, it is established
that the use of the MAP, L<sub>2</sub> norm or H<sub>1</sub> norm
regularization functional leads to a proof of linear convergence
of the conjugate gradient method in terms of the displacement errors
caused by the imperfect subpixel locations. Results of simulation

abstract = {Super-resolution enhancement algorithms are used to estimate a high-resolution
video still (HRVS) from several low-resolution frames, provided that
objects within the digital image sequence move with subpixel increments.
A Bayesian multiframe enhancement algorithm is presented to compute
an HRVS using the spatial information present within each frame as
well as the temporal information present due to object motion between
frames. However, the required subpixel-resolution motion vectors
must be estimated from low-resolution and noisy video frames, resulting
in an inaccurate motion field which can adversely impact the quality
of the enhanced image. Several subpixel motion estimation techniques
are incorporated into the Bayesian multiframe enhancement algorithm
to determine their efficacy in the presence of global data transformations
between frames (i.e., camera pan, rotation, tilt, and zoom) and independent
object motion. Visual and quantitative comparisons of the resulting
high-resolution video stills computed from two video frames and the
corresponding estimated motion fields show that the eight-parameter
projective motion model is appropriate for global scene changes,
while block matching and Horn-Schunck optical flow estimation each
have their own advantages and disadvantages when used to estimate
independent object motion. 1998 Academic Press.},

to quantitatively assess iron in the brain. Paramagnetic iron modifies
the magnetic susceptibility causing magnetic field inhomogeneity

of the susceptibility from the measured magnetic field is an ill-posed
inverse problem. In this work, a bayesian regularization approach
that adds spatial priors from the MR magnitude image is formulated
for susceptibility imaging. Priors include background regions of
known zero susceptibility and edge information from the magnitude
image. Simulation and phantom validation experiments demonstrated
accurate susceptibility maps free of artifacts. The ability to characterize
iron content in brain hemorrhage was demonstrated on patients with
cavernous hemangioma. Additionally, multiple structures within the

in nature, in which the number of observations n, the ambient signal

infnity in a general manner. This paper makes two novel contributions.
First, we provide sharper necessary conditions for exact support
recovery using general (non-Gaussian) dense measurement matrices.
Combined with previously known sucient conditions, this result yields
sharp characterizations of when the optimal decoder can recover a
signal for various scalings of the sparsity k and sample size n,
including the important special case of linear sparsity using a linear
scaling of observations. Our second contribution is to prove necessary
conditions on the number of observations n required for asymptotically
reliable recovery using a class of sparsifed measurement matrices,
where the measurement sparsity (n; p; k) 2 (0; 1] corresponds to
the fraction of non-zero entries per row. Our analysis allows general
scaling of the quadruplet (n; p; k;), and reveals three different
regimes, corresponding to whether measurement sparsity has no effect,
a minor effect, or a dramatic effect on the information-theoretic

abstract = {Least-squares and linear programming algorithms for the interpretation of NMR relaxation data in terms of a spectrum of relaxation times are presented. These stable methods are noniterative and avoid all of the difficulties associated with nonlinear optimization schemes. Moreover, they are not restricted by any assumptions which limit the number of possible relaxation times. The inherent nonuniqueness due to the finite number of inaccurate measurements means that a variety of discrete and continuous spectra exist which fit the data equally well. For a complete interpretation the range of possible solutions must be examined. The algorithms discussed explore the space of acceptable solutions by constructing relaxation spectra from a continuum of models ranging from a few isolated delta functions to a continuous distribution. Alternatively, the interpreter can choose that class of spectrum (discrete or continuous) which best represents the physical system under investigation and so enhance the reliability of the interpretation. This flexibility is essential in order to avoid the pitfalls of interpreting a single spectrum returned by a single algorithm. In addition, the linear programming approach reduces the non-uniqueness by constructing unique information in the form of bounds on all spectra which satisfy the observations. These bounds and the corresponding extreme models are necessary for any quantitative determination of how spectral peaks change in amplitude or position with a change in the physical system.0 1989 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {We investigated whether the simultaneous use of paramagnetic contrast
medium and 3D on-resonance spin lock (SL) imaging could improve the
contrast of enhancing brain tumors at 0.1 T. A phantom containing
serial concentrations of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) in cross-linked
bovine serum albumin (BSA) was imaged. Eleven patients with histologically
verified glioma were also studied. T1-weighted 3D gradient echo images
with and without SL pulse were acquired before and after a Gd-DTPA
injection. SL effect, contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)
were calculated for each patient. In the glioma patients, the SL
effect was significantly smaller in the tumor than in the white and
gray matter both before (p = 0.001, p = 0.025, respectively), and
after contrast medium injection (p \&lt; 0.001, p \&lt; 0.001, respectively).
On post-contrast images, SL imaging significantly improved tumor
contrast (p = 0.001) whereas tumor CNR decreased slightly (p = 0.024).
The combined use of SL imaging and paramagnetic Gd-DTPA contrast
agent offers a modality for improving tumor contrast in magnetic

SL imaging has also shown potential to increase tissue characterization

This work develops an automated procedure to design single-shot trajectories that create a local resolution improvement in a region of interest. The technique is based on the design of optimized local k-space trajectories and can be applied to arbitrary hardware configurations that employ any number of linear and nonlinear encoding fields. The trajectories designed in this work are tested with the currently available hardware setup consisting of three standard linear gradients and two quadrupolar encoding fields generated from a custom-built gradient insert. A field camera is used to measure the actual encoding trajectories up to third-order terms, enabling accurate reconstructions of these demanding single-shot trajectories, although the eddy current and concomitant field terms of the gradient insert have not been completely characterized. The local resolution improvement is demonstrated in phantom and in vivo experiments. Magn Reson Med, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

With recent technical developments, several ultrafast scanning techniques capable of acquiring images in a breath-hold now find their introduction into clinical use. The system improvements are potentially useful for a vast range of applications hitherto not accessible to MR imaging. Among these are functional brain imaging, realtime imaging of cardiac motion and perfusion, fast abdominal imaging, improved MR angiography, and potentially real-time monitoring of interventional procedures. Whereas some ultrafast techniques can be performed on conventional scanners, echo-planar imaging, the fastest currently available data acquisition strategy, requires specially designed hardware. This article provides on overview of the technical advances in the ultrafast MRI and discusses potential applications and the possible future impact on body scanning.},

These artifacts cannot be described by a simple smearing out of the image in the phase direction. Proper distribution of the phase-encoding steps on the echoes can be used to minimize artifacts and even lead to resolution enhancement. In spite of the short data acquisition times, the signal amplitudes of structures with long T2 are nearly the same as those in a conventional 2D FT experiment.

for partially parallel image acquisitions using many of the existing

prior proposals for parallel imaging, SMASH reconstruction involves
a small set of MR signal combinations prior to Fourier transformation,
which can be advantageous for artifact handling and practical implementation.
A twofold savings in image acquisition time is demonstrated here

of greater numbers of independent surface coils placed so as to minimize
aliasing along the phase-encode direction(s). However, gains from
increasing the number of coils diminish as coil coupling problems
begin to dominate and the ratio of acceleration gain to expense for
multiple receiver chains becomes prohibitive. In this work, we redesign
the spatial-encoding strategy in order to gain efficiency, achieving
a gradient encoding scheme that is complementary to the spatial encoding
provided by the receiver coils. This approach leads to O-space
imaging, wherein the gradient shapes are tailored to an existing
surface coil array, making more efficient use of the spatial information
contained in the coil profiles. In its simplest form, for each acquired
echo the Z2 spherical harmonic is used to project the object onto
sets of concentric rings, while the X and Y gradients are used to
offset this projection within the imaging plane. The theory is presented,
an algorithm is introduced for image reconstruction, and simulations
reveal that O-space encoding achieves high encoding efficiency compared
to sensitivity encoding (SENSE) radial k-space trajectories, and
parallel imaging technique with localized gradients (PatLoc), suggesting
that O-space imaging holds great potential for accelerated scanning.},

to neuroscience, with its use for virtually all functional MRI (fMRI)
and diffusion imaging of fiber connections in the human brain. EPI
generates a single 2D image in a fraction of a second; however, it
requires 23 seconds to acquire multi-slice whole brain coverage
for fMRI and even longer for diffusion imaging. Here we report on
a large reduction in EPI whole brain scan time at 3 and 7 Tesla,
without significantly sacrificing spatial resolution, and while gaining
functional sensitivity. The multiplexed-EPI (M-EPI) pulse sequence
combines two forms of multiplexing: temporal multiplexing (<italic>m</italic>)
utilizing simultaneous echo refocused (SIR) EPI and spatial multiplexing
(<italic>n</italic>) with multibanded RF pulses (MB) to achieve <italic>m</italic><italic>n</italic>
images in an EPI echo train instead of the normal single image. This
resulted in an unprecedented reduction in EPI scan time for whole
brain fMRI performed at 3 Tesla, permitting TRs of 400 ms and 800
ms compared to a more conventional 2.5 sec TR, and 24 times reductions
in scan time for HARDI imaging of neuronal fibertracks. The simultaneous
SE refocusing of SIR imaging at 7 Tesla advantageously reduced SAR
by using fewer RF refocusing pulses and by shifting fat signal out
of the image plane so that fat suppression pulses were not required.
In preliminary studies of resting state functional networks identified
through independent component analysis, the 6-fold higher sampling
rate increased the peak functional sensitivity by 60\%. The novel
M-EPI pulse sequence resulted in a significantly increased temporal
resolution for whole brain fMRI, and as such, this new methodology
can be used for studying non-stationarity in networks and generally
for expanding and enriching the functional information.</p> },

abstract = {After conception and implementation of any new

medical image processing algorithm, validation is an important

step to ensure that the procedure fulfills all requirements set

forth at the initial design stage. Although the algorithm must be

evaluated on real data, a comprehensive validation requires the

additional use of simulated data since it is impossible to establish

ground truth with in vivo data. Experiments with simulated data

permit controlled evaluation over a wide range of conditions (e.g.,

different levels of noise, contrast, intensity artefacts, or geometric

distortion). Such considerations have become increasingly important

with the rapid growth of neuroimaging, i.e., computational

analysis of brain structure and function using brain scanning

methods such as positron emission tomography and magnetic

resonance imaging.

Since simple objects such as ellipsoids or parallelepipedes do

not reflect the complexity of natural brain anatomy, we present

the design and creation of a realistic, high-resolution, digital,

volumetric phantom of the human brain. This three-dimensional

digital brain phantom is made up of ten volumetric data sets

that define the spatial distribution for different tissues (e.g.,
grey

matter, white matter, muscle, skin, etc.), where voxel intensity is

proportional to the fraction of tissue within the voxel. The digital

brain phantom can be used to simulate tomographic images of

the head. Since the contribution of each tissue type to each

voxel in the brain phantom is known, it can be used as the

gold standard to test analysis algorithms such as classification

procedures which seek to identify the tissue type of each image

voxel. Furthermore, since the same anatomical phantom may be

used to drive simulators for different modalities, it is the ideal
tool

to test intermodality registration algorithms. The brain phantom

@article{Zhang200145,
abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based
model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information
is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined
images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not
the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias
field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden
Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated
by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which
can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically,
it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the
HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way
in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences
of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in
MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods
are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based
approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show
that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into
a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved.
More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with
other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction
algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into
this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach
for brain MR image segmentation.},

for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 4 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
T1 measurements were made with a progressive saturation sequence,
an implementation of the Look-Locker sequence, and an inversion-recovery
(IR) interleaved echo-planar imaging (IEPI) sequence. T2 measurements
were made with a standard spin-echo (SE) sequence and an SE IEPI
sequence. RESULTS: The T1 measurements yielded values of 1,724 msec
+/- 51 for gray matter, 1,043 msec +/- 27 for white matter, and 4,550
msec +/- 800 msec for cerebrospinal fluid. The deep gray matter regions
had T1 values of 1,458 +/- 38 (caudate nucleus) and 1,372 +/- 60
(putamen). The T2 measurements yielded results of 63 msec +/- 6.2
for gray matter and 49.8 msec +/- 2.2 for white matter. CONCLUSION:
The T1 values measured at 4 T show a higher value than predicted
from extrapolation at lower field strengths. The T2 measurements
showed a slight decrease in values over those measured at lower-field
strength. The gain in signal-to-noise ratio from the higher field
strength may be substantially offset by these altered relaxation
time values to a degree that is sequence dependent},

Along with the principles of 2D SENSE imaging, the properties of
the technique are discussed and investigated by means of simulations.
Special attention is given to the role of the coil configuration,

for a voxel of spins evolving in a strong nonlinear field, specifically
focusing on the quadratic z2 (x2 + y2) field. Dephasing under
nonlinear gradients is increasingly relevant given the growing interest
in nonlinear imaging, and here, we report several notable differences
from the linear case. Most notably, in addition to signal loss, intravoxel
dephasing under gradients creating a wide and asymmetric frequency
distribution across the voxel can cause skewed and nonlinear phase
evolution. After presenting the qualitative and analytical origins
of this difference, we experimentally demonstrate that neglecting
these dynamics can lead to significant errors in sequences that assume
phase evolution is proportional to voxel frequency, such as those
used for field mapping. Finally, simplifying approximations to the
signal equations are presented, which not only provide more intuitive
forms of the exact expression but also result in simple rules to
predict key features of the nonlinear evolution. Magn Reson Med,

abstract = {Abstract A method is presented for rapid simultaneous quantification
of the longitudinal T1 relaxation, the transverse T2 relaxation,
the proton density (PD), and the amplitude of the local radio frequency
B1 field. All four parameters are measured in one single scan by
means of a multislice, multiecho, and multidelay acquisition. It
is based on a previously reported method, which was substantially
improved for routine clinical usage. The improvements comprise of
the use of a multislice spin-echo technique, a background phase correction,
and a spin system simulation to compensate for the slice-selective
RF pulse profile effects. The aim of the optimization was to achieve
the optimal result for the quantification of magnetic resonance parameters
within a clinically acceptable time. One benchmark was high-resolution
coverage of the brain within 5 min. In this scan time the measured
intersubject standard deviation (SD) in a group of volunteers was
2\% to 8\%, depending on the tissue (voxel size = 0.8 0.8 5 mm).
As an example, the method was applied to a patient with multiple
sclerosis in whom the diseased tissue could clearly be distinguished
from healthy reference values. Additionally it was shown that, using
the approach of synthetic MRI, both accurate conventional contrast
images as well as quantification maps can be generated based on the

The high sampling rate is achieved at the cost of some spatial resolution.
The article describes a novel imaging method for fast three-dimensional-MR-encephalography
whole brain coverage based on rosette trajectories and the use of
multiple small receiver coils. The technique allows the observation
of changes in brain physiology at very high temporal resolution.
A highly undersampled three-dimensional rosette trajectory is chosen,
to perform single shot acquisition of k-space data within 23 msec.
By using a 32-channel head coil array and regularized nonuniform
Fourier transformation reconstruction, the spatial resolution is
sufficient to detect even subtle centers of activation (e.g. human
MT+). The method was applied to visual block design paradigms and
compared with echo planar imaging-based functional MRI. As a proof-of-principle
of the method's ability to detect local differences in the hemodynamic
response functions, the analyzed MR-encephalography data revealed
a spatially dependent delay of the arrival of the blood oxygenation
level dependent response within the visual cortex. Magn Reson Med,

abstract = {To characterize gradient field nonuniformity and its effect on velocity
encoding in phase contrast (PC) MRI, a generalized model that describes
this phenomenon and enables the accurate reconstruction of velocities
is presented. In addition to considerable geometric distortions,
inhomogeneous gradient fields can introduce deviations from the nominal
gradient strength and orientation, and therefore spatially-dependent
first gradient moments. Resulting errors in the measured phase shifts
used for velocity encoding can therefore cause significant deviations
in velocity quantification. The true magnitude and direction of the
underlying velocities can be recovered from the phase difference
images by a generalized PC velocity reconstruction, which requires
the acquisition of full three-directional velocity information. The
generalized reconstruction of velocities is applied using a matrix
formalism that includes relative gradient field deviations derived
from a theoretical model of local gradient field nonuniformity. In
addition, an approximate solution for the correction of one-directional
velocity encoding is given. Depending on the spatial location of
the velocity measurements, errors in velocity magnitude can be as
high as 60\%, while errors in the velocity encoding direction can
be up to 45. Results of phantom measurements demonstrate that effects
of gradient field nonuniformity on PC-MRI can be corrected with the
proposed method. Magn Reson Med 50:791801, 2003. Published 2003

@article{Ohliger2003,
abstract = {Abstract A method is described for establishing an upper bound on
the spatial encoding capabilities of coil arrays in parallel MRI.
Ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), independent of any
particular conductor arrangement, is calculated by expressing arbitrary
coil sensitivities in terms of a complete set of basis functions
that satisfy Maxwell's equations within the sample and performing
parallel imaging reconstructions using these basis functions. The
dependence of the ultimate intrinsic SNR on a variety of experimental
conditions is explored and a physically intuitive explanation for
the observed behavior is provided based on a comparison between the
electromagnetic wavelength and the distance between aliasing points.
Imaging at high field strength, with correspondingly short wavelength,
is shown to offer advantages for parallel imaging beyond those already
expected due to the larger available spin polarization. One-dimensional
undersampling of k-space yields a steep drop in attainable SNR for
more than a 5-fold reduction of scan time, while 2D undersampling
permits access to much higher degrees of acceleration. Increased
tissue conductivity decreases baseline SNR, but improves parallel
imaging performance. A procedure is also provided for generating
the optimal coil sensitivity pattern for a given acceleration, which
will serve as a useful guide for future coil designs.},

Tracking the population of spins in many coherence pathways via the iterated method of the Extended Phase Graph algorithm allows for accurate quantification of echo magnitudes. The resulting decay curves allow for correction of errors due to nonideal refocusing pulses as a result of inhomogeneities in the B1 transmit field. Non-Negative Least Squares fitting is used to quantify the magnitude of T2 components at various T2 values. This method, allowing calculation of the T2 distribution with simultaneous extraction of the refocusing pulse flip angle, requires no change to image acquisition procedures and no extra data input. Validation by means of both simulations and in vivo data shows excellent interscan reproducibility while vastly improving the accuracy of extracted T2 parameters in voxels where poor B1 homogeneity leads to refocusing pulse flip angles significantly less than 180.

abstract = {The maximum likelihood (ML) approach to estimating the radioactive
distribution in the body cross section has become very popular among
researchers in emission computed tomography (ECT) since it has been
shown to provide very good images compared to those produced with
the conventional filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm. The expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm is an often-used iterative approach for
maximizing the Poisson likelihood in ECT because of its attractive
theoretical and practical properties. Its major disadvantage is that,
due to its slow rate of convergence, a large amount of computation
is often required to achieve an acceptable image. Here, the authors
present a row-action maximum likelihood algorithm (RAMLA) as an alternative
to the EM algorithm for maximizing the Poisson likelihood in ECT.
The authors deduce the convergence properties of this algorithm and
demonstrate by way of computer simulations that the early iterates
of RAMLA increase the Poisson likelihood in ECT at an order of magnitude
faster that the standard EM algorithm. Specifically, the authors
show that, from the point of view of measuring total radionuclide
uptake in simulated brain phantoms, iterations 1, 2, 3, and 4 of
RAMLA perform at least as well as iterations 45, 60, 70, and 80,
respectively, of EM. Moreover, the authors show that iterations 1,
2, 3, and 4 of RAMLA achieve comparable likelihood values as iterations

abstract = {In magnetic resonance, time-varying gradient magnetic fields (dB/dt)
may stimulate nerves or muscles by inducing electric fields in patients.
Models predicted mean peripheral nerve and cardiac stimulation thresholds.
For gradient ramp durations of less than a few milliseconds, mean
peripheral nerve stimulation is a safe indicator of high dB/dt. At
sufficient amplitudes, peripheral nerve stimulation is perceptible
(ie, tingling or tapping sensations). Magnetic fields from simultaneous
gradient axes combine almost as a vector sum to produce stimulation.
Patients may become uncomfortable at amplitudes 50\%100\% above
perception thresholds. In dogs, respiratory stimulation has been
induced at about 300\% of mean peripheral nerve thresholds. Cardiac
stimulation has been induced in dogs by small gradient coils at thresholds
near Reilly's predictions. Cardiac stimulation required nearly 80
times the energy needed to produce nerve stimulation in dogs. Nerve
and cardiac stimulation thresholds for dogs were unaffected by 1.5-T
magnetic fields. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2000;12:2029. 2000

abstract = {Abstract Quantitative mapping of the myelin water content can provide
significant insight into the pathophysiology of several white matter
diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and leukoencephalopathies, and
can potentially become a useful clinical tool for early diagnosis
of these diseases. In this study, multicompartment analysis of T2*
decay (MCAT2*) was used for the quantitative mapping of myelin water
fraction (MWF). T2* decay of each voxel at multiple slice locations
was acquired in fixed human brains using a multigradient-echo (MGRE)
pulse sequence with alternating readout gradient polarities. Compared
to prior techniques using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) acquisition,
the MGRE acquisition approach has: 1) a very short first echo time
(2 ms) and echo-spacing (1 ms), which allows for the acquisition
of multiple sampling points during the fast decay of the myelin water
signal; 2) a low RF duty cycle, which is especially important for
achieving acceptable specific absorption rate (SAR) levels at high
field strengths. Multicompartment analysis was then applied to the
T2* decay in each pixel using a 3-pool model of white matter to
detect the signal arising from the myelin water, myelinated axonal
water, and mixed water compartments. Magn Reson Med 58:865870,

abstract = {Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and partial Fourier techniques have been
shown to reduce the acquisition time and provide high diagnostic
quality images. However, for time-resolved acquisitions there is
a need for both high temporal and spatial resolution. View sharing
can be used to provide an increased frame rate but at the cost of
acquiring spatial frequencies over a duration longer than a frame
time. In this work we hypothesize that a CArtesian Projection Reconstruction-like
(CAPR) technique in combination with 2D SENSE, partial Fourier, and
view sharing can provide 1-2 mm isotropic resolution with sufficient
temporal resolution to distinguish intracranial arterial and venous
phases of contrast passage in whole-brain angiography. In doing so,
the parameter of temporal footprint is introduced as a descriptor
for characterizing and comparing time-resolved view-shared pulse
sequences. It is further hypothesized that short temporal footprint
sequences have higher temporal fidelity than similar sequences with
longer temporal footprints. The tradeoff of temporal footprint and
temporal acceleration is presented and characterized in numerical
simulations. Results from 11 whole-brain contrast-enhanced MR angiography
studies with the new method with SENSE acceleration factors R = 4

when spatial encoding is performed with three or more encoding channels
for a 2D image. Materials and methods The recently developed 4-Dimensional
Radial In/Out (4D-RIO) trajectory is compared in simulations to an
alternative higher-order encoding scheme referred to as O-space imaging.
Direct comparison of local k -space representations leads to the
proposal of a modification to the O-space imaging trajectory based
on a scheme of prephasing to improve the reconstructed image quality.
Data were collected using a 4D-RIO acquisition in vivo in the human
brain and several image reconstructions were compared, exploiting
the property that the dense encoding matrix, after a 1D or 2D Fourier
transform, can be approximated by a sparse matrix by discarding entries
below a chosen magnitude. Results The proposed prephasing scheme
for the O-space trajectory shows a marked improvement in quality
in the simulated image reconstruction. In experiments, 4D-RIO data
acquired in vivo in the human brain can be reconstructed to a reasonable
quality using only 5\% of the encoding matrix massively reducing computer

to the problem of reconstructing a signal from its samples in some
"shift-invariant" space, which may or may not be bandlimited. In
this paper, we present some further justification for this type of
representation, while addressing the issue of the specification of
the best reconstruction space. We consider a realistic setting where
a multidimensional signal is prefiltered prior to sampling, and the
samples are corrupted by additive noise. We adopt a variational approach
to the reconstruction problem and minimize a data fidelity term subject
to a Tikhonov-like (continuous domain) L<sub>2</sub>-regularization
to obtain the continuous-space solution. We present theoretical justification
for the minimization of this cost functional and show that the globally
minimal continuous-space solution belongs to a shift-invariant space
generated by a function (generalized B-spline) that is generally
not bandlimited. When the sampling is ideal, we recover some of the
classical smoothing spline estimators. The optimal reconstruction
space is characterized by a condition that links the generating function
to the regularization operator and implies the existence of a B-spline-like
basis. To make the scheme practical, we specify the generating functions
corresponding to the most popular families of regularization operators
(derivatives, iterated Laplacian), as well as a new, generalized
one that leads to a new brand of Matrn splines. We conclude the
paper by proposing a stochastic interpretation of the reconstruction
algorithm and establishing an equivalence with the minimax and minimum

abstract = {Studies a new approach to estimating the component amplitudes and
decay rates of transient signals that consist of real decaying exponentials.
A set of predetermined ldquo;basis rdquo; exponentials is fitted
to discrete samples of a signal. The basis is required to be selective,
each basis exponential ldquo;selecting rdquo; signal exponents that
are close to its own and ldquo;rejecting rdquo; others. The first
part of the paper is concerned with determining such basis sets.
The authors take a single-exponential test signal, analyze it in
terms of the basis exponentials, and consider each fitted amplitude
as a function of test exponent. Each such function is then required
to peak in a manner familiar to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
theory, when the test and basis exponents coincide, diminishing in
magnitude as their difference increases. It is shown that for equispaced
data, such selective bases exist and are uniquely determined by model
order and sampling interval. Formulas for basis decay rates and fitting
amplitudes are obtained in closed form. It is shown that a time-bandwidth
relationship also holds. However, the selective basis set turns out
to be unacceptably sensitive to noise. The second part of the paper
explores a method to overcome this drawback. The authors study the
effect of overdetermination and a small simultaneous relaxation of
the peaked-shape requirement for a test exponential. Of these, the
latter implies usage of nonexponential basis functions, and this
is the more fundamental strategy},

@article{Mayer2007,
abstract = {Super-resolution (SR)-based methods that implement multiple data sets
related by spatial translations in the frequency-encoding (FE) direction
have recently been proposed for resolution enhancement in MRI. This
approach, however, was initially received with controversy. It was
suggested that when the shifts are applied in the FE direction, no
new information was acquired after the first image. Recent developments
suggest, however, that shifting the object between image acquisitions
can introduce new information to each data set. For this reason,
SRMRI may be possible in the FE direction. In this article, we point
out that the presence of new information in each acquisition is not
sufficient for an SR algorithm to be practical. Indeed, there are
situations where the amount of new information is relatively small
and possibly not even measurable in the presence of noise. We explore
the question of how much new information can be present in each acquisition
for FE SRMRI. In particular, we investigate the extent to which the
effect of the spatial shift - applied before the object is imaged
- can be undone using simple image-processing techniques. Visual
comparisons and numerical measures are used to characterize the amount
of new information that is acquired in each data set. It is shown
that since the amount of new information can be relatively small,
each image can be approximated by applying simple signal-processing
techniques to a single data set. Ultimately, our research suggests
that little progress may be possible by using this approach to perform
resolution enhancement in the FE direction. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

the application of external gradients to traverse the 2D Fourier

MRI. The constant component of magnetic field inhomogeneity can lead

abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of Compressed-Sensing (CS), images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A non-linear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this paper, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the L1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multi-slice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

abstract = {The problem of increasing the slice resolution of functional MRI (fMRI)
images without a loss in signal-to-noise ratio is considered. In
standard fMRI experiments, increasing the slice resolution by a certain
factor decreases the signal-to-noise ratio of the images with the
same factor. For this purpose an adapted EPI MRI acquisition protocol
is proposed, allowing one to acquire slice-shifted images from which
one can generate interpolated super-resolution images, with an increased
resolution in the slice direction. To solve the problem of correctness
and robustness of the created super-resolution images from these
slice-shifted datasets, the use of discontinuity preserving regularization
methods is proposed. Tests on real morphological, synthetic functional,
and real functional MR data-sets have been performed, by comparing
the obtained super-resolution datasets with high-resolution reference
datasets. In the morphological experiments the image spatial resolution
of the different types of images are compared. In the synthetic and
real fMRI experiments, on the other hand, the quality of the different
datasets is studied as function of their resulting activation maps.
From the results obtained in this study, we conclude that the proposed
super-resolution techniques can both improve the signal-to-noise
ratio and augment the detectability of small activated areas in fMRI
image sets acquired with thicker slices. 2004 Wiley Periodicals,

abstract = {Functional MRI has become an important tool of researchers and clinicians
who seek to understand patterns of neuronal activation that accompany
sensory and cognitive processes. However, the interpretation of fMRI
images rests on assumptions about the relationship between neuronal
firing and hemodynamic response that are not firmly grounded in rigorous
theory or experimental evidence. Further, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent
effect, which correlates an MRI observable to neuronal firing, evolves
over a period that is 2orders of magnitude longer than the underlying
processes that are thought to cause it. Here, we instead demonstrate
experiments to directly image oscillating currents by MRI. The approach
rests on a resonant interaction between an applied rf field and an
oscillating magnetic field in the sample and, as such, permits quantitative,
frequency-selective measurements of current density without spatial
or temporal cancellation. We apply this method in a current loop
phantom, mapping its magnetic field and achieving a detection sensitivity
near the threshold required for the detection of neuronal currents.
Because the contrast mechanism is under spectroscopic control, we
are able to demonstrate how ramped and phase-modulated spin-lock
radiation can enhance the sensitivity and robustness of the experiment.
We further demonstrate the combination of these methods with remote
detection, a technique in which the encoding and detection of an
MRI experiment are separated by sample flow or translation. We illustrate
that remotely detected MRI permits the measurement of currents in
small volumes of flowing water with high sensitivity and spatial
resolution.},

an approximate bSSFP signal equation is derived and applied to fit
the flip angle dependence of the in vivo bSSFP signal. Thereby, the
MWF and signal amplitude are fitted, while a priori assumptions are
made for the other parameters of the two-pool system. The effects
of magnetization transfer, finite RF pulses, B (0) and B (1) inhomogeneities,
as well as variation of the constant fit parameters, are investigated.
Acquisition and calculation of quantitative, high-resolution MWF

from numerical simulations indicate a severe dependence of the derived

in a time-shared manner during a swept radiofrequency excitation
of the nuclear spins. With negligible time between excitation and
signal acquisition, new possibilities exist for imaging objects consisting
of spins with extremely fast transverse relaxation rates, such as
macromolecules, semi-solids, and quadrupolar nuclei. The field gradient
used for spatial-encoding is not pulsed on and off, but rather is
stepped in orientation in an incremental manner, which results in
low acoustic noise. This unique acquisition method is expected to
be relatively insensitive to sample motion, which is important for
imaging live objects. Additionally, the frequency-swept excitation
distributes the signal energy in time and thus dynamic range requirements
for proper signal digitization are reduced compared with conventional
MRI. For demonstration, images of a plastic object and cortical bone

components analysis) and singular value decomposition, respectively.
We demonstrate that FR and SVD MRI are equivalent in the following
sense: given the same prior image data, they lead to exactly the
same basis functions. FR MRI utilized prior images of the same body
part in many 'training' subjects, thought to be similar to the 'unknown'
subject to be imaged. SVD MRI utilized a single prior image of one
subject in order to perform dynamic imaging of that subject. We demonstrate
that the basis function expansion derived from a single prior image
may not be capable of representing new features (features not found
in the prior image). Therefore, the SVD basis functions may be inappropriate
for dynamic imaging.},

abstract = {Magnetic susceptibility varies among brain structures and provides
insights into the chemical and molecular composition of brain tissues.
However, the determination of an arbitrary susceptibility distribution
from the measured MR signal phase is a challenging, ill-conditioned
inverse problem. Although a previous method named calculation of
susceptibility through multiple orientation sampling (COSMOS) has
solved this inverse problem both theoretically and experimentally
using multiple angle acquisitions, it is often impractical to carry
out on human subjects. Recently, the feasibility of calculating the
brain susceptibility distribution from a single-angle acquisition
was demonstrated using morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI).
In this study, we further improved the original MEDI method by sparsifying
the edges in the quantitative susceptibility map that do not have
a corresponding edge in the magnitude image. Quantitative susceptibility
maps generated by the improved MEDI were compared qualitatively and
quantitatively with those generated by calculation of susceptibility
through multiple orientation sampling. The results show a high degree
of agreement between MEDI and calculation of susceptibility through
multiple orientation sampling, and the practicality of MEDI allows
many potential clinical applications. Magn Reson Med, 2011. 2011

The T2 relaxation was multiexponential, indicating the multicompartmental nature of T2 decay in nerve tissue. The size of the short, observed T2 component correlated very well with quantitative assessment of myelin using computer-assisted histopathological image analysis of myelin. Specifically, the size of the short T2 component reflected the processes of myelin loss and remyelination accompanying Wallerian degeneration and regeneration following trauma. However, it represented all myelin present in the sample and did not distinguish between intact myelin and myelin debris. Other changes in T2 spectra were also observed and could be correlated with axonal loss and inflammation. The study also questions the validity of previously offered interpretations of T2 spectra of nerve. Magn Reson Med 49:638–645, 2003. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {This paper presents a combination of speculative approaches, some
related to earlier work and some apparently novel, which show great
promise in providing a new class of MRI machines that would be considerably
less expensive. This class would have advantages and disadvantages
as compared to existing MRI, over and above that of low cost. The
disadvantages include the apparent inability to perform classic spectroscopy,
and limited flexibility in the area of selective excitation. The
advantages include a fundamental immunity to inhoinogenelty and susceptibility
problems, the ability to create a wide class of machines that are
designed for specific anatomy-related applications, the ability to
design open machines for physician access, and improved capability
for high speed imaging. Generic to all of the methods presented are
a pulsed polarizing field and an oscillatory readout bias field.
The pulsed field initially polarizes the magnetic moments. Sinat
it is not on during the readout operation it has negligible homogeneity
requirements since changes in the field amplitude will merely shade
the image intensity. During readout a relatively low bias field is
used. To enable the use of a relatively inhomogeneous bias field,
an osciliatory field is used that has a zero average value. This
prevents any long-term buildup of phase errors due to a frequency
error associated with inhomogeneity. Thus the average bias frequency
will be determined solely by the frequency rather than the amplitude
of the bias field. Three methods are described, all including the
above features. The first two involve imaging in the laboratory frame,
while the third involves imaging in the rotating frame. The second
approach requires no RF excitation and the third approach uses RF
bias and gradient signals. Some approaches to slice selection are
described.},

an arbitrarily shaped object is presented. The ultimate intrinsic
SNR is determined by body noise. A solution is obtained by optimizing
the electromagnetic field to minimize total power deposition while
maintaining a constant right-hand circularly polarized component
of the magnetic field at the point of interest. A numerical approximation
for the optimal field is found by assuming a superposition of a large
number of plane waves. This simulation allowed estimation of the
ultimate intrinsic SNR attainable in a human torso model. The performance
of six coil configurations was evaluated by comparing the SNR of
images obtained by the coils with the ultimate values. In addition,
the behavior of ultimate intrinsic SNR was investigated as a function
of main field strength. It was found that the ultimate intrinsic
SNR increases better than linearly with the main magnetic field up
to 10 T for our model. It was observed that for field strengths of
4 T or higher, focusing is required to reach the ultimate intrinsic
SNR.},

the important symmetric diagonal dominant case if only part of the

to gain insight into the observations from multicomponent quantitative

Our results show that changes in the rate of water movement between

magnetization transfer imagingbased semisolid pool population
is robust, despite the presence of two distinct semisolid components;

abstract = {A new approach to measure activation-related changes in the brain
by magnetic resonance is described offering high temporal resolution
of 10-100 measurements per second. This is achieved by simultaneous
multi-channel reception where the spatial resolution during continuous
observation is determined by the sensitive volume of each coil alone
without any additional spatial encoding gradients. Experimental results
demonstrate the very high sensitivity of this approach, which allows
to directly measure and monitor the stimulus-dependent hemodynamic
response as well as ECG- and breathing-related signal fluctuations.
One-dimensional spatial encoding either parallel or orthogonal to
the cortex demonstrates that vascular signals can be identified by
the pronounced signal variation at the ECG-frequency. Noise analysis
at different frequencies reveals regional signal fluctuations in
the frequency range between 2 and 10Hz. Furthermore, initial results
show that frequency changes in the order of <0.03Hz corresponding
to <1 nano Tesla can be detected. In addition to its potential use
in neuroscientific studies, this new method opens a wide range of
applications for fast physiological monitoring and can be easily
combined with conventional high-resolution imaging.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion imaging is potentially an important tool
for the noninvasive characterization of normal and pathological tissue.
The technique, however, is prone to a number of artifacts that can
severely affect its ability to provide clinically useful information.
In this study, the problem of eddy current-induced geometric distortions
that occur in diffusion images acquired with echo planar sequences
was addressed. These geometric distortions produce artifacts in computed
maps of diffusion parameters and are caused by misalignments in the
individual diffusion-weighted images that comprise the diffusion
data set. A new approach is presented to characterize and calibrate
the eddy current effects, enabling the eddy current distortions to
be corrected in sets of Interleaved (or snapshot) echo planar diffusion
images. Correction is achieved by acquiring one-dimensional field
maps in the read and phase encode direction for each slice and each
diffusion step. The method is then demonstrated through the correction
of distortions in diffusion images of the human brain. It is shown
that by using the eddy current correction scheme outlined, the eddy
current-induced artifacts in the diffusion-weighted images are almost
completely eliminated. In addition, there is a significant improvement
in the quality of the resulting diffusion tensor maps.},

neural stimulation indicates that, for trapezoidal gradient waveforms

creating a triangular waveform can prove advantageous over the use
of simple sinusoidal modulation. For example, a higher image resolution
is in principle possible before the neural stimulation limit is reached.
For higher modulation frequencies and fast ramp trapezoidal waveforms,
the peak gradient can be lower than that for a sinusoidal waveform
by a factor approaching 2/ for equal resolution. This means that
by using a multimode resonant gradient drive, the amplifier power
requirements are greatly relaxed. The signal sampling bandwidth required
is also lower, because, due to the trapezoidal nonlinear sample pattern,
sample points are spaced linearly during the waveform plateaus.},

The consequent high field homogeneity allows free induction decay signals lasting 100 ms or more to be readily achieved. The small droplet dimensions allow the magnetic field to be measured even in the presence of large gradients. Highly sensitive detection yields sufficient SNR to follow the relevant field evolution without signal averaging and at bandwidths up to hundreds of kHz. Transient, nonreproducible effects and drifts are thus readily monitored. The typical application of k-space trajectory mapping has been demonstrated. Potential further applications include characterization, tuning, and maintenance of gradient systems as well as the mapping of the static field distribution of MRI magnets.

abstract = {The goal of this study was to use linear optimization techniques as
a systematic method of cine phase contrast pulse sequence design
and to apply this technique to the measurement of blood flow in vivo.
The optimized waveforms were validated in a constant flow phantom
with average velocities ranging from 5 to 50 cm/s. The same optimized
sequence was also run in a segmented k-space variation with five
phase encoding lines per segment. The magnetic resonance (MR) derived
velocity measurements were accurate over the entire range of velocities
tested (p \&lt; .05) in both cases. The same optimized pulse sequence
was applied to the measurement of flow in the main pulmonary artery
of five normal volunteers and compared with stroke volumes and cardiac
outputs calculated from right ventricular volume measurements. These
measurements showed a mean difference between the MR phase contrast
calculated stroke volume and the volumetric stroke volume measurement
of 9.8 11.6\%. The mean difference between the calculated phase
contrast cardiac output and the volumetric cardiac output was 4.4
10\%. These results imply that optimization techniques are an efficient
method for designing cine phase contrast pulse sequences.},

abstract = {Minimal bounds on the mean square error (MSE) are

generally used in order to predict the best achievable performance

of an estimator for a given observation model. In this paper, we are

interested in the Bayesian bound of the WeissWeinstein family.

Among this family, we have Bayesian Cramr-Rao bound, the Bobrovsky

MayerWolfZaka bound, the Bayesian Bhattacharyya

bound, the BobrovskyZaka bound, the ReuvenMesser bound,

and the WeissWeinstein bound. We present a unification of

all these minimal bounds based on a rewriting of the minimum

mean square error estimator (MMSEE) and on a constrained

optimization problem. With this approach, we obtain a useful

theoretical framework to derive new Bayesian bounds. For that

purpose, we propose two bounds. First, we propose a generalization

of the Bayesian Bhattacharyya bound extending the works

of Bobrovsky, MayerWolf, and Zaka. Second, we propose a

bound based on the Bayesian Bhattacharyya bound and on the

ReuvenMesser bound, representing a generalization of these

bounds. The proposed bound is the Bayesian extension of the

deterministic Abel bound and is found to be tighter than the

Bayesian Bhattacharyya bound, the ReuvenMesser bound, the

BobrovskyZaka bound, and the Bayesian CramrRao bound.

We propose some closed-form expressions of these bounds for a

general Gaussian observation model with parameterized mean. In

order to illustrate our results, we present simulation results in
the

abstract = {The human visual system appears to be capable of temporally integrating
information in a video sequence in such a way that the perceived
spatial resolution of a sequence appears much higher than the spatial
resolution of an individual frame. While the mechanisms in the human
visual system that do this are unknown, the effect is not too surprising
given that temporally adjacent frames in a video sequence contain
slightly different, but unique, information. This paper addresses
how to use both the spatial and temporal information present in a
short image sequence to create a single high-resolution video frame.
A novel observation model based on motion compensated subsampling
is proposed for a video sequence. Since the reconstruction problem
is ill-posed. Bayesian restoration with a discontinuity-preserving
prior image model is used to extract a high-resolution video still
given a short low-resolution sequence. Estimates computed from a
low-resolution image sequence containing a subpixel camera pan show
dramatic visual and quantitative improvements over bilinear, cubic
B-spline, and Bayesian single frame interpolations. Visual and quantitative
improvements are also shown for an image sequence containing objects
moving with independent trajectories. Finally, the video frame extraction
algorithm is used for the motion-compensated scan conversion of interlaced
video data, with a visual comparison to the resolution enhancement
obtained from progressively scanned frames. 1996 IEEE.},

abstract = {Seizure related abnormalities may be detected with T2 relaxometry,
which involves quantitative estimation of T2 values. Accounting for
the partial-volume effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is important,
especially for voxel-based relaxometry, VBR. With a mono-exponential
decay model, this can be accomplished by including a baseline constant.
An algebraic calculation, which accommodates this constant, offers
improved T2 estimation speed over the commonly used non-linear fitting
approach. Our objective was to compare the algebraic approach against
three fitting approaches for the detection of seizure related abnormalities.
We tested the performance of the four methods in the presence of
noise using simulated data as well as real data acquired at 3 T with
a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence from 45 healthy subjects and
24 patients with confirmed right temporal lobe epilepsy. A quantitative
analysis was performed on spatially normalized data by measuring
T2 in various regions and with a whole brain tissue segmentation
analysis. The detection rate of hippocampal T2 changes in patients
was assessed by comparing the regional T2 measurements from each
patient against the control data with a z-score threshold of 2.33.
The algebraic method yielded high sensitivity for detection of hippocampal
abnormalities in the epileptic patients in regional assessment and
in follow-up single-subject VBR. This can be attributed to the relatively
small variance across healthy subjects and improved precision in
the presence of CSF and noise in simulation. In conclusion, the algebraic
method is better than fitting based on faster calculation speed and
better sensitivity for detecting seizure-related T2 changes.},

abstract = {Purpose. To evaluate a multislice nonlinearly-spaced 12-echo imaging
sequence at 3T covering the supratentorial brain for the quantification
of myelin water fraction (MWF) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
Methods. Eighty-nine patients with, or at risk of, MS (69 relapsing
remitting MS [RRMS], 7 secondary progressive MS [SPMS], 13 clinically
isolated syndrome [CIS]) and 28 controls were studied. Twelve-echo
datasets were acquired using a multislice T2 prep spiral imaging
sequence and were fitted using a nonnegative least squares algorithm.
The mean MWF within normal appearing white matter (NAWM), contrast-enhancing
(CE), and nonenhancing T2 lesions were calculated. Results. Mean
MWF in white matter for controls was 11.3\%. Mean MWF was significantly
reduced in NAWM of MS patients (10.6\%, P= .004) relative to controls.
SPMS/RRMS patients with disease duration >5 years (10.3\%) had lower
MWF compared to CIS/RRMS with disease duration 5 years (10.8\%,
P= .03). Mean MWF was reduced by 26\% and 29\% within both CE (P <
.0001) and nonenhancing T2 lesions (P < .0001) relative to controls.
Conclusions. Using a multicomponent T2 sequence at 3T, a significant
decrease in the supratentorial MWF was observed in MS NAWM and lesions
relative to controls. The method was sensitive to detect white matter
changes early in the disease process.},

abstract = {Measurement of proton transverse relaxation rates (R2) is a generally
useful means for quantitative characterization of pathological changes
in tissue with a variety of clinical applications. The most widely
used R 2 measurement method is the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG)
pulse sequence but its relatively long scan time requires respiratory
gating for chest or body MRI, rendering this approach impractical
for comprehensive assessment within a clinically-acceptable examination
time. The purpose of our study was to develop a breathhold multiecho
fast spin-echo (FSE) sequence for accurate measurement of R2 in the
liver and heart. Phantom experiments and studies of subjects in vivo
were performed to compare the FSE data with the corresponding even-echo
CPMG data. For pooled data, the R2 measurements were strongly correlated
(Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.99) and in excellent agreement
(mean difference [CPMG - FSE] = 0.10 s-1; 95\% limits of agreement
were 1.98 and -1.78 s-1) between the two pulse sequences. 2009

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is limited in many cases by long
scan times and low spatial resolution. Recent advances in gradient
systems hardware allow very rapid imaging sequences, such as steady-state
free precession (SSFP), which has repetition times (TRs) of 25
ms. The design of these rapid sequences demands time-optimal preparatory
gradient waveforms to provide maximum readout duty-cycle, and preserve
spatial resolution and SNR while keeping TRs low. Time-optimal gradient
waveforms can be synthesized analytically for certain simple cases.
However, certain problems, such as time-optimal 2D and 3D gradient
design with moment constraints, either may not have a solution or
must be solved numerically. We show that time-optimal gradient design
is a convex-optimization problem, for which very efficient solution
methods exist. These methods can be applied to solve gradient design
problems for oblique gradient design, spiral imaging, and flow-encoding
using either a constant slew rate or the more exact voltage-limited
gradient models. Ultimately, these methods provide a time-optimal
solution to many 2D and 3D gradient design problems in a sufficiently
short time for interactive imaging. Magn Reson Med 51:8192, 2004.

abstract = {In clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), any reduction in scan time offers a number of potential benefits ranging from high-temporal-rate observation of physiological processes to improvements in patient comfort. Following recent developments in compressive sensing (CS) theory, several authors have demonstrated that certain classes of MR images which possess sparse representations in some transform domain can be accurately reconstructed from very highly undersampled K-space data by solving a convex lscr1-minimization problem. Although lscr1-based techniques are extremely powerful, they inherently require a degree of over-sampling above the theoretical minimum sampling rate to guarantee that exact reconstruction can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the CS paradigm based on homotopic approximation of the lscr0 quasi-norm and show how MR image reconstruction can be pushed even further below the Nyquist limit and significantly closer to the theoretical bound. Following a brief review of standard CS methods and the developed theoretical extensions, several example MRI reconstructions from highly undersampled K-space data are presented.},

abstract = {Objectives: The paper presents a novel and more generalized concept
for spatial encoding by non-unidirectional, non- bijective spatial
encoding magnetic fields (SEMs). In combination with parallel local
receiver coils these fields allow one to overcome the current limitations
of neuronal nerve stimulation. Additionally the geometry of such
fields can be adapted to anatomy. Materials and methods: As an example
of such a parallel imaging technique using localized gradients (PatLoc)-
system, we present a polar gradient system consisting of 2 8 rectangular
current loops in octagonal arrangement, which generates a radial
magnetic field gradient. By inverting the direction of current in
alternating loops, a near sinusoidal field variation in the circumferential
direction is produced. Ambiguities in spatial assignment are resolved
by use of multiple receiver coils and parallel reconstruction. Simulations
demonstrate the potential advantages and limitations of this approach.
Results and conclusions: The exact behaviour of PatLoc fields with
respect to peripheral nerve stimulation needs to be tested in practice.
Based on geometrical considerations SEMs of radial geometry allow
for about three times faster gradient switching compared to conventional
head gradient inserts and even more compared to whole body gradients.
The strong nonlinear geometry of the fields needs to be considered
for practical applications. 2008 ESMRMB.},

abstract = {Despite continuous hardware advances, MRI is frequently subject to
field perturbations that are of higher than first order in space
and thus violate the traditional k-space picture of spatial encoding.
Sources of higher order perturbations include eddy currents, concomitant
fields, thermal drifts, and imperfections of higher order shim systems.
In conventional MRI with Fourier reconstruction, they give rise to
geometric distortions, blurring, artifacts, and error in quantitative
data. This work describes an alternative approach in which the entire
field evolution, including higher order effects, is accounted for
by viewing image reconstruction as a generic inverse problem. The
relevant field evolutions are measured with a third-order NMR field
camera. Algebraic reconstruction is then formulated such as to jointly
minimize artifacts and noise in the resulting image. It is solved
by an iterative conjugate-gradient algorithm that uses explicit matrix-vector
multiplication to accommodate arbitrary net encoding. The feasibility
and benefits of this approach are demonstrated by examples of diffusion
imaging. In a phantom study, it is shown that higher order reconstruction
largely overcomes variable image distortions that diffusion gradients
induce in EPI data. In vivo experiments then demonstrate that the
resulting geometric consistency permits straightforward tensor analysis

abstract = {Radially encoded MRI has gained increasing attention due to its motion
insensitivity and reduced artifacts. However, because its samples
are collected nonuniformly in the k-space, multidimensional (especially
3-D) radially sampled MRI image reconstruction is challenging. The
objective of this paper is to develop a reconstruction technique
in high dimensions with on-the-fly kernel calculation. It implements
general multidimensional nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT)
algorithms and incorporates them into a k-space image reconstruction
framework. The method is then applied to reconstruct from the radially
encoded k-space data, although the method is applicable to any non-Cartesian
patterns. Performance comparisons are made against the conventional
Kaiser-Bessel (KB) gridding method for 2-D and 3-D radially encoded
computer-simulated phantoms and physically scanned phantoms. The
results show that the NUFFT reconstruction method has better accuracy-efficiency
tradeoff than the KB gridding method when the kernel weights are
calculated on the fly. It is found that for a particular conventional
kernel function, using its corresponding deapodization function as
a scaling factor in the NUFFT framework has the potential to improve
accuracy. In particular, when a cosine scaling factor is used, the
NUFFT method is faster than KB gridding method since a closed-form
solution is available and is less computationally expensive than
the KB kernel (KB griding requires computation of Bessel functions).
The NUFFT method has been successfully applied to 2-D and 3-D in
vivo studies on small animals.},

abstract = {Myelin water imaging (MWI) promises to be invaluable in understanding
neurological diseases like MS. However, a limitation of MWI is signal
to noise ratio. Recently, a number of investigators have performed
MWI at field strengths higher than 1.5T. Our goal was to determine
if myelin water imaging at increased SNR, arising from the use of
a small bore 7T MR system with optimized coil geometry, enables
the production of superior myelin water maps with increased spatial
detail and enables better correlations with histology. Ten formalin-fixed
MS brain samples underwent a 32-echo T2 relaxation experiment which
measured myelin water fraction (MWF) on a 7-T animal MRI scanner.
MWF correlated strongly qualitatively and quantitatively with luxol
fast blue staining for myelin [mean (range): R2\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.78
(0.560.95), p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.0001]. The quality and detail of
7T myelin water maps were far superior to that previously seen
at 1.5T, allowing for visualization of fine structures such as
the normal prominent myelination of the deeper cortical layers, the
alveus of the hippocampus and rings of preserved myelin in a concentric
Balo's lesion. 7T imaging will allow detailed assessment of myelin
pathology to a degree not possible with lower field strengths.},

abstract = {Context While gray matter T2 hypointensity in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been associated with physical disability and clinical course, previous studies have relied on visual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments. Objective To quantitatively determine if T2 hypointensity is associated with conventional MRI and clinical findings in MS. Design Case-control study. Setting University-affiliated community-based hospital. Subjects Sixty patients with MS and 50 controls. Main Outcome Measures T2 intensities of the substantia nigra, red nucleus, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, and caudate; third ventricular width; total brain T1 (hypointense) and T2 (hyperintense) lesion volumes; Expanded Disability Status Scale (physical disability) score; and disease course. Results Deep gray matter T2 hypointensity was present in patients with MS in all structures (P<.005) except for the substantia nigra. T2 hypointensity was associated with third ventricle enlargement and higher T2 but not T1 plaque load. The regression model predicting third ventricle width included caudate T2 hypointensity (P = .006). The model predicting T2 lesion load included globus pallidus T2 hypointensity (P = .001). Caudate T2 hypointensity was the only variable associated with disability score in regression modeling (P = .03). All T2 hypointensities differentiated the secondary progressive from the relapsing-remitting clinical courses. The final model (P<.001) predicting clinical course retained T2 hypointensity of the thalamus, caudate, and putamen but not MRI plaques or atrophy. Conclusions Gray matter T2 hypointensity in MS is associated with brain atrophy and is a stronger predictor of disability and clinical course than are conventional MRI findings. While longitudinal studies are warranted, these results suggest that pathologic iron deposition is a surrogate marker of the destructive disease process.},

abstract = {In many biological systems, nuclear magnetic resonance chemical-shift
studies of 31P, 13C, and 1H can be of great value as a means of studying
metabolic processes in vivo. This information is likely to be of
great clinical value in the diagnosis of disease and in the study
and monitoring of the effect of drug treatment. This paper discusses
two new techniques, based on the echo-planar imaging (EPI) method.
One is the echo-planar shift mapping (EPSM) technique and the other
is a hybrid projection reconstruction-echo-planar (PREP) method.
Both methods may be used to obtain complete chemical-shift spectra
at each point of a specified grid in a chosen plane through the subject.
A major attraction of the EPSM method is the very high speed at which
this information is obtained. The major attraction of the PREP hybrid
method is its simplicity. Both techniques have the advantage of speed
and efficiency over both the point-by-point topical magnetic resonance
(TMR) and 3D Fourier transform approaches. The new mapping techniques
may also be used to measure magnetic field spatial inhomogeneities,
caused by either the presence of magnetic material or simply nonalignment

The signals are sparse in some transform domain referred to as the

sparsity pattern of the signal's transform coefficients' vector changes
slowly over time, and (b) a simple prior model on the temporal dynamics

our solution is to use CS to estimate the support set of the initial

abstract = {To increase image acquisition efficiency, we develop alternative gradient
encoding strategies designed to provide spatial encoding complementary
to the spatial encoding provided by the multiple receiver coil elements

is achieved when the magnetic field encoding gradients are designed
to encode spatial information where receiver spatial encoding is
ambiguous, for example, along sensitivity isocontours. Specifically,
the method generates a basis set for the null space of the coil sensitivities
with the singular value decomposition and calculates encoding fields
from the null space vectors. A set of nonlinear gradients is used
as projection imaging readout magnetic fields, replacing the conventional
linear readout field and phase encoding. Multiple encoding fields
are used as projections to capture the null space information, hence
the term null space imaging. The method is compared to conventional
Cartesian SENSitivity Encoding as evaluated by mean squared error
and robustness to noise. Strategies for developments in the area
of nonlinear encoding schemes are discussed. The null space imaging
approach yields a parallel imaging method that provides high acceleration
factors with a limited number of receiver coil array elements through
increased time efficiency in spatial encoding. Magn Reson Med, 2011.

A.W. Song, An improved gridding method for spiral MRI using nonuniform
fast Fourier transform, J. Magn. Reson. 162(2) (2003) 250-258] proposed
an alternative method based on a nonuniform FFT (NUFFT) with least-squares
(LS) design of the interpolation coefficients. They described this
LS\_NUFFT method as shift variant and reported that it yielded smaller
reconstruction approximation errors than the conventional shift-invariant
KB approach. This paper analyzes the LS\_NUFFT approach in detail.
We show that when one accounts for a certain linear phase factor,
the core of the LS\_NUFFT interpolator is in fact real and shift invariant.
Furthermore, we find that the KB approach yields smaller errors than
the original LS\_NUFFT approach. We show that optimizing certain scaling
factors can lead to a somewhat improved LS\_NUFFT approach, but the
high computation cost seems to outweigh the modest reduction in reconstruction
error. We conclude that the standard KB approach, with appropriate
parameters as described in the literature, remains the practical

@article{Yablonskiy2005,
abstract = {While MRI at very low magnetic fields has certain potential advantages,
it may also face problems that are not typical for MRI at conventional
and high field (0.110 T). Major differences arise due to the presence
of concomitant components of inhomogeneous magnetic field (gradients)
that are transverse to the major Bz field, B0. These concomitant
transverse field components are inevitably generated by the same
gradient coils that generate desired Bz imaging gradients as routinely
used in MRI for spatial encoding. In the hypothetical case (linear
spatial variation of Bz field amplitude due to the imaging gradients,
no concomitant transverse field components, no B0 and B1 field inhomogeneities,
etc.), Fourier transform MRI preserves the shape of the real object
being examined. It is demonstrated herein that unavoidable concomitant
transverse field gradients, G, result in an image deformation of
the object!s actual shape by bending straight lines and planes with
a characteristic curvature radius Rc = B0/G. For imaging gradients
on the order of 10 mT/m and B0 of 1 T, the radius Rc is about 100
m and image distortions are generally negligible. However, for B0
of 1 mT, Rc is 10 cm, which is less than a typical FOV in human studies.
This manuscript derives expressions describing geometrical relationships
between the imaged object and the obtained MR data. In addition to
geometrical distortions, image intensity will be modulated in a complex,
spatially dependent manner. Hence, if unaccounted for, corresponding
image distortionsgeometry and

abstract = {Parallel imaging technique using localized gradients (PatLoc) uses the combination of surface gradient coils generating nonbijective curvilinear magnetic fields for spatial encoding. PatLoc imaging using one pair of multipolar spatial encoding magnetic fields (SEMs) has two major caveats: (1) The direct inversion of the encoding matrix requires exact determination of multiple locations which are ambiguously encoded by the SEMs. (2) Reconstructed images have a prominent loss of spatial resolution at the center of field-of-view using a symmetric coil array for signal detection. This study shows that a PatLoc system actually has a higher degree of freedom in spatial encoding to mitigate the two challenges mentioned above. Specifically, a PatLoc system can generate not only multipolar but also linear SEMs, which can be used to reduce the loss of spatial resolution at the field-of-view center. Here, we present an efficient and generalized image reconstruction method for PatLoc imaging using multiple SEMs without explicitly identifying the locations where SEM encoding is not unique. Reconstructions using simulations and empirical experimental data are compared with those using conventional linear gradients to demonstrate that the general combination of SEMs can improve image reconstructions.

abstract = {The solution q of the imaging equation Mq=FGq=p (F is the projector
and G is a generalized backprojector) is determined using least squares,
thus various basis functions can be used as an expansion for the
reconstructed image. Here, a generalized natural pixel basis is chosen
to allow flexibility in formulating the vector space for the solution
q. The singular value decomposition (SVD) method is used to solve
for q, and the final image is obtained by backprojecting q: rho;=Gq,
and sampling rho; at a discrete array of points. Truncated parallel
and non-truncated fan beam projection measurements were used to demonstrate
that the solution q to Mq=FGq=p can be defined wherein, for example,
if F is a fan beam projection operator, G can be a parallel backprojection
operator defined base upon natural pixels. It is demonstrated that
different backprojection geometries can give almost equivalent reconstructions
of non-truncated projections. For truncated projections the estimation
of q that covers the entire projection of the object is effective
in reducing ring artifacts; however, using more projection bins is
much more effective in preserving the resolution than is increasing
the projection bin width. Also, a generalized natural pixel basis
better models the geometric response of a collimator used in SPECT,
therefore reconstructions of fan beam projections using generalized
natural pixels are shown to have better resolution than those that
use the filtered backprojection algorithm},

abstract = {A model for water-macromolecular magnetization transfer is presented
which addresses the mechanism of coupling between the hydrogen populations
and the extraction of physically meaningful parameters from experimental
magnetization transfer data. Both physical exchange between bulk-solvent
and site-specific hydration-layer hydrogens and intermolecular magnetic
dipolar coupling between these specific hydration-layer-solvent and
macromolecular hydrogens are explicitly included, leading to a three-pool
model for magnetization transfer. It is shown that the three-pool
model is well approximated by a two-pool model for coupling between
the bulk-solvent and macromolecular hydrogens when the dipolar-coupled
solvent hydrogens are a small fraction of the total solvent, and
the solvent-macromolecular coupling constant includes both dipolar
magnetic, [kappa]dip, and physical exchange, [kappa]ex, coupling
rates. The model is also extended to multiple solvent systems. The
model results in a set of coupled equations that predict magnetization
transfer spectra as a function of temperature and composition. Physically
meaningful constraints on the coupling and relaxation parameters
are established for systems in which magnetization transfer has been
observed including solvated cross-linked proteins and lipid bilayers.
Using parameter estimates based on these constraints, empirical magnetization
transfer spectra are well predicted by the model. It is found that
the degree of magnetization transfer becomes independent of [kappa]dip
and [kappa]ex when these parameters become greater than about 50
s-1. In the semi-rigid cross-linked protein systems where the mobility
of the macromolecular matrix is insensitive to temperature, the magnitude
of the observed magnetization transfer is consistent with being limited
by the intermolecular dipolar coupling and spin-lattice relaxation
in the bulk-solvent phase. },

abstract = {Conventionally, MR images are formed by applying gradients

to the main static magnetic field (B0). However, the B0 gradient

equipment is expensive, power-hungry, complex, and

noisy and can induce eddy currents in nearby conducting

structures, including the patient. Here, we describe a new

silent, B0 gradient-free MRI principle, Transmit Array Spatial

Encoding (TRASE), based on phase gradients of the radio-frequency

(RF) field. RF phase gradients offer a new method of

k-space traversal. Echo trains using at least two different RF

phase gradients allow spin phase to accumulate, causing kspace

traversal. Two such RF fields provide one-dimensional

imaging and three are sufficient for two-dimensional imaging.

Since TRASE is a k-space method, analogues of many conventional

pulse sequences are possible. Experimental results

demonstrate one-dimensional and two-dimensional RF MRI

and slice selection using a single-channel, transmit/receive,

0.2 T, permanent magnet, human MR system. The experimentally

demonstrated spatial resolution is much higher than

that provided by RF receive coil array sensitivity encoding

alone but lower than generally achievable with B0 gradients.

Potential applications are those in which one or more of the

features of simplified equipment, lower costs, silent MRI, or

the different physics of the image formation process are particularly

advantageous},

constraints that the super-resolution image should generate the low
resolution input images when appropriately warped and down-sampled

are normally combined with some form of smoothness prior to regularize
their solution.) In the first part of this paper, we derive a sequence
of analytical results which show that the reconstruction constraints
provide less and less useful information as the magnification factor
increases. We also validate these results empirically and show that,
for large enough magnification factors, any smoothness prior leads
to overly smooth results with very little high-frequency content

part of this paper, we propose a super-resolution algorithm that
uses a different kind of constraint, in addition to the reconstruction
constraints. The algorithm attempts to recognize local features in
the low-resolution images and then enhances their resolution in an
appropriate manner. We call such a super-resolution algorithm a hallucination

abstract = {When surface radiofrequency coils are used for irradiation and detection, the pulse angles are greatest in the plane of the coil and decrease rapidly with depth of penetration into the sample and this intrinsic spatial variation in pulse angle makes it difficult to use multipulse NMR techniques. However, it is shown that spin-echo pulse sequences may still be used provided the refocusing pulses are cycled through all four phases as described by Bodenhausen et al. (J. Magn. Reson. 27, 511 (1977)). This has the added advantage that signals are markedly reduced from sample regions where there is a large deviation from an ideal pulse angle. Thus the scheme also functions as a depth pulse sequence, and this property is preserved even when there are no delay periods. Additional depth discrimination is obtained by using additional phase-cycled pulses, e.g., the depth pulseAnalysis of the phase alternation introduced by Demco et al. (J. Magn. Reson. 16, 467 (1974)) for inversion-recovery T1 measurements shows that when this is combined with the above cycled pulses, additional depth discrimination is obtained and accurate t1 measurements may be made even when there are large divergences from the ideal pulse angles. Thus is a very good depth pulse may be used for inversion-recovery T1, measurements and-may be used for spin-echo sequences. Several simple spin-echo sequences are presented. These techniques help to relax the constraints on radio-frequency coil design imposed by the requirement to have good B1, homogeneity and therefore may have more general application, especially in cases where the need for a large filling factor is at a premium.},

the performance of two-dimensional parametric shape estimators. Assuming
an asymptotically normal and efficient estimator for a finite parameterization

confidence region, centered around the true boundary. Computation
of the probability that an entire boundary estimate lies within the
confidence region is a challenging problem, because the estimate
is a two-dimensional nonstationary random process. We derive lower
bounds on this probability using level crossing statistics. The same
bounds also apply to asymptotic confidence regions formed around
the estimated boundaries, lower-bounding the probability that the
entire true boundary lies within the confidence region. The results
make it possible to generate asymptotic confidence regions for arbitrary
prescribed probabilities. These asymptotic global confidence regions
conveniently display the uncertainty in various geometric parameters
such as shape, size, orientation, and position of the estimated object,
and facilitate geometric inferences. Numerical simulations suggest
that the new bounds are quite tight.},

abstract = {Fluorescence molecular tomography is a powerful tool for 3D visualization
of molecular targets and pathways in vivo in small animals. Owing
to the high degrees of absorption and scattering of light through
tissue, the fluorescence tomographic inverse problem is inherently
ill-posed. In order to improve source localization and the conditioning
of the light propagation model, multiple sets of data are acquired
by illuminating the animal surface with different spatial patterns
of near-infrared light. However, the choice of these patterns in
most experimental setups is ad hoc and suboptimal. This paper presents
a systematic approach for designing efficient illumination patterns
for fluorescence tomography. Our objective here is to determine how
to optimally illuminate the animal surface so as to maximize the
information content in the acquired data. We achieve this by improving
the conditioning of the Fisher information matrix. We parameterize
the spatial illumination patterns and formulate our problem as a
constrained optimization problem that, for a fixed number of illumination
patterns, yields the optimal set of patterns. For geometric insight,
we used our method to generate a set of three optimal patterns for
an optically homogeneous, regular geometrical shape and observed
expected symmetries in the result. We also generated a set of six
optimal patterns for an optically homogeneous cuboidal phantom set
up in the transillumination mode. Finally, we computed optimal illumination
patterns for an optically inhomogeneous realistically shaped mouse
atlas for different given numbers of patterns. The regularized pseudoinverse
matrix, generated using the singular value decomposition, was employed
to reconstruct the point spread function for each set of patterns
in the presence of a sample fluorescent point source deep inside
the mouse atlas. We have evaluated the performance of our method
by examining the singular value spectra as well as plots of average
spatial resolution versus estimator variance corresponding to different
illumination schemes. 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering

abstract = {Spin echoes have been known since 1950. Although their formal description
by use of the Bloch equations is straightforward, it does not lead
to an intuitive understanding of their behavior except for the special
cases of 180 or 90 pulses, especially when many pulses are applied
before the magnetization has returned into thermal equilibrium. The
extended-phasegraph algorithm, which takes into account that the
total magnetization in spin-echo sequences is a superposition of
many isochromats, allows the recognition of all possible echo signals
in arbitrary pulse sequences. Its application to multi-echo sequences
leads to a number of surprising results. It can be demonstrated that
refocusing pulses with flip angles much lower than 180 generate
an unexpectedly high signal intensity after a few echo periods. Apart
from leading to a simple algorithm for the exact calculation of echo
intensities in arbitrary multi-pulse sequences, the phase-graph algorithm
leads to a simple understanding of the contrast behavior of different
gradient echo sequences and gives a rational means for the design
of MR-imaging sequences that are free from spurious echoes.},

It can be estimated directly from the complex valued data set, or one can first perform a magnitude operation on this data set, which changes the distribution of the data from Gaussian to Rician, and estimate the signal amplitude from the obtained magnitude image. Similarly, the noise variance can be estimated from both the complex and magnitude data sets.

abstract = {Echo-planar imaging (EPI) can provide rapid imaging by acquiring a
complete k-space data set in a single acquisition. However, this
approach suffers from distortion effects in geometry and intensity,
resulting in poor image quality. The distortions, caused primarily
by field inhomogeneities, lead to intensity loss and voxel shifts,
the latter of which are particularly severe in the phase-encode direction.
Two promising approaches to correct the distortion in EPI are field
mapping and point spread function (PSF) mapping. The field mapping
method measures the field distortions and translates these into voxel
shifts, which can be used to assign image intensities to the correct
voxel locations. The PSF approach uses acquisitions with additional
phase-encoding gradients applied in the x, y, and/or z directions
to map the 1D, 2D, or 3D PSF of each voxel. These PSFs encode the
spatial information about the distortion and the overall distribution
of intensities from a single voxel. The measured image is the convolution
of the undistorted density and the PSF. Measuring the PSF allows
the distortion in geometry and intensity to be corrected. This work
compares the efficacy of these methods with equal time allowed for
field mapping and PSF mapping. Magn Reson Med 48:137146, 2002.

abstract = {A novel, fully 3D, high-resolution T1 and T2 relaxation time mapping method is presented. The method is based on steady-state imaging with T1 and T2 information derived from either spoiling or fully refocusing the transverse magnetization following each excitation pulse. T1 is extracted from a pair of spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) images acquired at optimized flip angles. This T1 information is combined with two refocused steady-state free precession (SSFP) images to determine T2. T1 and T2 accuracy was evaluated against inversion recovery (IR) and spin-echo (SE) results, respectively. Error within the T1 and T2 maps, determined from both phantom and in vivo measurements, is approximately 7\% for T1 between 300 and 2000 ms and 7\% for T2 between 30 and 150 ms. The efficiency of the method, defined as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the final map per voxel volume per square root scan time, was evaluated against alternative mapping methods. With an efficiency of three times that of multipoint IR and three times that of multiecho SE, our combined approach represents the most efficient of those examined. Acquisition time for a whole brain T1 map (25 x 25 x 10 cm) is less than 8 min with 1 mm3 isotropic voxels. An additional 7 min is required for an identically sized T2 map and postprocessing time is less than 1 min on a 1 GHz PIII PC. The method therefore permits real-time clinical acquisition and display of whole brain T1 and T2 maps for the first time. 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {In this paper, we model the components of the compressive sensing
(CS) problem, i.e., the signal acquisition process, the unknown signal
coefficients and the model parameters for the signal and noise using
the Bayesian framework. We utilize a hierarchical form of the Laplace
prior to model the sparsity of the unknown signal. We describe the
relationship among a number of sparsity priors proposed in the literature,
and show the advantages of the proposed model including its high
degree of sparsity. Moreover,we show that some of the existing models
are special cases of the proposed model. Using our model, we develop
a constructive (greedy) algorithm designed for fast reconstruction
useful in practical settings. Unlike most existing CS reconstruction
methods, the proposed algorithm is fully automated, i.e., the unknown
signal coefficients and all necessary parameters are estimated solely
from the observation, and, therefore, no user-intervention is needed.
Additionally, the proposed algorithm provides estimates of the uncertainty
of the reconstructions.We provide experimental results with synthetic

@article{Tian2010,
abstract = {The objective of super-resolution (SR) imaging is to reconstruct a
single higher-resolution image based on a set of lower-resolution
images that were acquired from the same scene to overcome the limitations
of image acquisition process for facilitating better visualization
and content recognition. In this paper, a stochastic Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) SR image reconstruction approach is proposed.
First, a Bayesian inference formulation, which is based on the observed
low-resolution images and the prior high-resolution image model,
is mathematically derived. Second, to exploit the MCMC sample-generation
technique for the stochastic SR image reconstruction, three fundamental
issues are observed as follows. First, since the hyperparameter value
of the prior image model controls the degree of regularization and
intimately affects the quality of the reconstructed high-resolution
image, how to determine an optimal hyperparameter value for different
low-resolution input images becomes a very challenging task. Rather
than exploiting the exhaustive search, an iterative updating approach
is developed in this paper by allowing the value of hyperparameter
being simultaneously updated in each sample-generation iteration.
Second, the samples generated during the so-called burn-in period
(measured in terms of the number of samples initially generated)
of the MCMC-based sample-generation process are considered unreliable
and should be discarded. To determine the length of the burn-in period
for each set of low-resolution input images, a time-period bound
in closed form is mathematically derived. Third, image artifacts
could be incurred in the reconstructed high-resolution image, if
the number of samples (counting after the burn-in period) generated
by the MCMC-based sample-generation process is insufficient. For
that, a variation-sensitive bilateral filter is proposed as a 'complementary'
post-processing scheme, to improve the reconstructed high-resolution
image quality, when the number of samples is insufficient. Extensive
simulation results have clearly shown that the proposed stochastic
SR image reconstruction method consistently yields superior performance.

abstract = {The driven-equilibrium single-pulse observation of T1 (DESPOT1) and
T2 (DESPOT2) are rapid, accurate, and precise methods for voxelwise
determination of the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times.
A limitation of the methods, however, is the inherent assumption
of single-component relaxation. In a variety of biological tissues,
in particular human white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM), the relaxation
has been shown to be more completely characterized by a summation
of two or more relaxation components, or species, each believed to
be associated with unique microanatomical domains or water pools.
Unfortunately, characterization of these components on a voxelwise,
whole-brain basis has traditionally been hindered by impractical
acquisition times. In this work we extend the conventional DESPOT1
and DESPOT2 approaches to include multicomponent relaxation analysis.
Following numerical analysis of the new technique, renamed multicomponent
driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1/T2 (mcDESPOT),
whole-brain multicomponent T1 and T2 quantification is demonstrated
in vivo with clinically realistic times of between 16 and 30 min.
Results obtained from four healthy individuals and two primary progressive
multiple sclerosis (MS) patients demonstrate the future potential
of the approach for identifying and assessing tissue changes associated
with several neurodegenerative conditions, in particular those associated

excitation with a spatially varying B1 causes flip-angle artifacts

T1rho contrast. In this study, we overcome the former complication
with a specially designed spin-locking pulse sequence and we successfully
obtain T1rho-weighted images with a surface coil. In this pulse sequence,
the spin-lock pulse was divided into segments of equal duration and
alternating phase. This self-compensating T1-preparatory pulse
sequence was analyzed and the effect of an inhomogeneous B1 field
was simulated using the Bloch equations. T1-weighted MR images of
a phantom and a human knee joint in vivo were obtained on a clinical
scanner with a surface coil to demonstrate the utility of the pulse
sequence. The self-compensating T1-prepared pulses sequence resulted
in substantially reduced image artifacts compared to the conventional,

advantages over its counterparts at higher magnetic fields. These
include narrow line widths, the possibility of novel imaging schemes,
reduced imaging artifacts from susceptibility variations within a
sample, and reduced system cost and complexity. In addition, ULF
NMR/MRI with superconducting quantum interference devices is compatible
with simultaneous measurements of biomagnetic signals, a capability
conventional systems cannot offer. Acquisition of MRI at ULF must,
however, account for concomitant gradients that would otherwise result
in severe image distortions. In this paper, we introduce the general
theoretical framework that describes concomitant gradients, explain
why such gradients are more problematic at low field, and present
possible approaches to correct for these unavoidable gradients in

@article{Fessler2005,
abstract = {AbstractIn some types of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging,

particularly functional brain scans, the conventional Fourier

model for the measurements is inaccurate. Magnetic field inhomogeneities,

which are caused by imperfect main fields and by

magnetic susceptibility variations, induce distortions in images

that are reconstructed by conventional Fourier methods. These artifacts

hamper the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) in brain

regions near air/tissue interfaces. Recently, iterative methods that

combine the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm with nonuniform

FFT (NUFFT) operations have been shown to provide considerably

improved image quality relative to the conjugate-phase

method. However, for non-Cartesian k-space trajectories, each

CG-NUFFT iteration requires numerous k-space interpolations;

these are operations that are computationally expensive and poorly

suited to fast hardware implementations. This paper proposes a

faster iterative approach to field-corrected MR image reconstruction

based on the CG algorithm and certain Toeplitz matrices.

This CG-Toeplitz approach requires k-space interpolations only

for the initial iteration; thereafter, only fast Fourier transforms

(FFTs) are required. Simulation results show that the proposed

CG-Toeplitz approach produces equivalent image quality as the

CG-NUFFT method with significantly reduced computation time},

bring insight into the problem of identifying multiple parameters.
For example, it is the angle between a given sensitivity vector and
the linear subspace spanned by all other sensitivity vectors that
determines the variance bound for identifying a given parameter.
Similarly, the covariance for identifying the linear influence of
two different subsets of parameters depends on the principal angles
between the linear subspaces spanned by the sensitivity vectors for
the respective subsets. These geometrical interpretations may also
be given filtering interpretations in a related multivariate normal

abstract = {Nonlinear spatial encoding fields for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hold great promise to improve on the linear gradient approaches by, for example, enabling reduced imaging times. Imaging schemes that employ general nonlinear encoding fields are difficult to analyze using traditional measures. In particular, the resolution is spatially varying, characterized by a position-dependent point spread function (PSF). Likewise, the use of nonlinear encoding fields creates an additional spatial dependence on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Although the two properties of resolution and SNR are linked, in this work we focus on the latter. To this end, we examine the pixel variance, which requires a computation that is often not feasible for nonlinear encoding schemes. This paper presents a general formulation for the performance analysis of imaging schemes using arbitrary encoding fields. The analysis leads to the derivation of a practical and computationally efficient performance metric, which is demonstrated through simulation examples.},

imaging through the use of a discrete wavelet transform is presented.
The paper reports the first implementation of wavelet encoding using
the Haar basis. Theoretically, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for
two levels of wavelet encoding is expected to be approximately 1.6
times higher than for conventional multislice imaging in which each
slice is exceed separately. A slightly lower SNR is encountered experimentally
because of slice interference. The design of radiofrequency (RF)
pulses to excite slices approximating Haar wavelet basis functions
is discussed. Wavelet encoding also provides an efficient method
for balancing slice thickness and SNR after an image has been acquired.
The experiments have been conducted at 1.5 Tesla. Wavelet encoding
of slices should be especially suitable for low-field MRI, in which
the SNR is lower and the characteristically lower T<sub>1</sub> values
favor the use of shorter TR, which sometimes forces the slices to
be acquired in multiple passes.},
